<p><br />The Golem is an allegory for a thought from created with Kabbalistic knowledge. However the Rabbi writes the word AMT on the Golem's forehead to bring this to life and if they wish to destroy it they remove the Aleph leaving only MT which means death. Why is this so....</p>
<p>The reason for this conceals what they are doing. AMT are the three core letters of the 22 letter Hebrew alphabet. Aleph, Mem, Tav. The removing of the Aleph causes the dissipation of the Hebrew thought from because the Tav blends into the Aleph thus keeping a cycle of energy going like spinning a wheel of energy. Aleph is symbolic of the energies of all the other letters in the Hebrew Alphabet. By removing the Aleph your pulling the plug on the power source. Kabala shows the letter Aleph as a wheel. Its about stopping the flow of energies.</p>
<p>In the Taro which is from the Kabala all the main 22 cards are based on Hebrew letters. The Wheel of Fortune shows that Torah is an anagram for Rotah which means wheel. In Kabala the symbol of the egg is called the wheel of life as wheel as it spins symbolizing that energy generates life as a new life hatches out of the cosmic egg. The wheel from India to the west was shown as the symbol of energy in motion. Chakra means spinning wheel. As stated Kabala shows the wheel as represented the letter Aleph for this reason. Note Taro.....Torah. Note Rah means evil in Hebrew. Rotah means the wheel of Ra, which means THE WHEEL OF EVIL in Hebrew. This is the Wheel of Samsara in the east which means the Wheel of death and suffering. For the Gentiles. The Jewish Book of Life is the Book of Death for the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Hence AMT means life. The Torah is the wheel of life for the Jews its the thought form they have created. The five books are based on the five elements that "god" created life with in kabala by making the first Golem the Adamon Kadmon which is the title of this thought form in many Kabbalistic traditions. The Jews call the Torah: The Book of Life.</p>
<p>There is a second method of using the Alphabet the Rabbi's keep secret the AMT is the method of "Gods" mercy meaning creation and generation of life for the Jew. The second is hidden its called "Gods" Judgement which is based on reversing letters to bring death. This is for punishing their fellow Jews as each Jew is given a special Hebrew name that is designed to connection to a specific passage in the Torah that each Jew recites in prayer at some point and connects their soul into this deeper. Each Jew has a letter in the Torah in Judaism. This connects into the individual soul of that Jew. This is what is meant by having ones name wrote in the Book of Life which gives the Jew everlasting existence. This was carried into Christianity but lost its meaning in the Christian context.</p>
<p>The hidden method of "Gods" Judgement is to punish the individual Jew by ERASING THEIR NAME FROM THE BOOK OF LIFE. Which is "Gods" ultimate judgement against an offending Jew in Judaism. This is how they do this and why.</p>
<p>So by using the Reverse Torah Rituals you are erasing every Jew from their Book of Life the Torah. The other meaning of the Aleph shown as the wheel is the wheel of the year the Jews do their major Torah reading on to keep the wheel of energy going the Aleph symbolizes the energy of the Torah. By doing the Reverse Torah Rituals at these points we are dissipating this energy. And thus their Book of Life.</p>
<p>The Rabbi's stated AMT is what gives life to the Jewish Book of Life and MT is what brings death to it. That is what these Reverse Torah Rituals do. Its right in the Rabbi's own magical texts which they hid. But Satan and our Gods showed us how to do this. Thus fulfilling the prophecy of the Rabbi's that Satan would destroy the Jews by erasing them from their Book of Life.</p>
<p>Do the Reverse Torah Rituals everyday.</p>
