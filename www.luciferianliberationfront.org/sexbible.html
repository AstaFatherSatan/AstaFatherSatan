<H4>According to recent Gallup Polls, over 83% of the population of the United
States believe that the Bible is God's Word. The Bible is the world's all-time,
best selling book with over 2 billion copies sold in at least 1,800 languages,
yet paradoxically it is probably the least COMPLETELY read book in the history
of the world. If more people actually took the time to read what was actually
in the Bible, there would be a lot less people who still believed that it had
been authored by an omnipotent, perfectly &quot;virtuous&quot; creator.</H4>
<H4>The Bible tells us that God's work is &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;without
iniquity&quot; (Deut. 32:4). It also tells us that &quot;every word of God is
pure&quot; (Prov. 30:5). Given these statements, the Bible should reflect the
nature of God, it should contain nothing which may be considered profane,
vulgar, or obscene. But as Thomas Paine commented in <I>The Age of Reason,</I>
&quot;Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the
cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with which more
than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it
the word of a demon than the word of God.&quot; </H4>
<H4>Christians are the first to raise the banner of literary morality and
censorship yet ironically if they applied their same standards of judgment to
their own Bible, it would have been banned and condemned as filth centuries
ago. The following examples come straight from the &quot;good book&quot; itself
and have been commented on or explained in more modern terms to facilitate the
understanding of today's readers. The material contained on this webpage may
not be suitable for younger audiences, but if it's good enough for God and his
book...who are we to judge? We're just trying to point out that the emporer is
wearing no clothing.</H4>

<P>One of the reasons why the general public is not outraged about the sexual
content in the Bible is that many modern readers don't understand the 17th
century Old English which the King James version of the Bible was translated
into. The more modern translations also tend to water-down those passages which
are less than pleasing and alter the original intent of the authors of the
Bible. For example, Ezekiel 23:20 speaks of a whore who lusts after men who
have penises as big as donkeys and who ejaculate as much as horses. The
original King James translation says it this way: </P>
<P><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and
whose issue is like the issue of horses.&quot;</FONT></EM></P>
<P>And the Revised Standard Version puts it like this:</P>
<P><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;whose members were like those of asses, and
whose issue was like that of horses.&quot;</FONT></EM></P>
<P>The Good News Bible translation completely removes the reference to the
sexual organs and discharges of these animals, calling it merely
&quot;lustfullness&quot; as follows:</P>
<P><EM><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;She was filled with lust for oversexed men
who had all the lustfulness of donkeys or stallions.&quot; </FONT></EM></P>
<P>The actual intent of some biblical passages is masked by the use of phrases
or words which don't carry the same meaning in today's society. One example of
this is the use of the word &quot;feet.&quot; In some passages, the word feet
is used to mean &quot;genitals.&quot; For example, Ruth snuck into the barn
where her prospective husband was sleeping and she layed down next to him and
uncovered his &quot;feet.&quot; Apparently she was &quot;checking out the goods
before she purchased&quot; and the man, realizing that he was uncovered wakes
up afraid (as Noah was when his nakedness was uncovered, See <A
HREF="#expose">Indecent Exposure</A>) until Ruth proposed to him, then he
realized that he was not threatened (Ruth 3:7-8). The Bible warns that God will
make mothers who don't obey him eat their own newborn children which
&quot;cometh out from between her feet.&quot; (Deut. 28:57) The Bible also
tells of a time when the Israelites would be taken captive by the Assyrian
king, who would shave their heads and their pubic hair, describing it as
&quot;the hair of the feet&quot; (Isaiah 7:20).</P>
<P>Another example of how meaning gets lost in the translation can be seen in
the use of the word &quot;knew&quot; for &quot;had sexual intercourse
with.&quot; Whenever Adam had sex with Eve it is described as &quot;And Adam
knew Eve his wife&quot; (Gen. 4:1). Some other ways the Bible has for saying a
man had sex with a woman include &quot;he went in unto her&quot; (Gen. 38:2, 9,
18) or &quot;he took so and so to wife.&quot; (Exodus 6:20) Perhaps if the
Bible stated &quot;And Adam had sex with Eve&quot; more people would see that
it couldn't be the word of a virtuous God, but that would require that they
actually READ the Bible first.</P>
<HR>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="incest"><U>Incest is
Best</U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>Sexual relations between related people commonly took place in the Bible
even though the Hebrew law specifically forbade it (Lev. 20:11, 17, Deut.
22:30, 27:22). </P>
<P>Cain was the first born son of Adam and Eve, according to the Bible (Gen.
4:1,2). The Bible tells us that &quot;Cain knew his wife; and she
conceived.&quot; (Gen. 4:17) If Adam and Eve were the only couple created by
God, then Cain must have had an incestuous relationship with his own sister.
Why incest was okay in this incident but is not okay in others is a mystery. 
</P>
<P>Abraham was married to his half-sister as were numerous other biblical
characters (Genesis 20:12)</P>
<P>Moses, the leader of Israel, was born of an incestuous relationship (Exodus
6:20)</P>
<P>Lot was saved from the fiery destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah just so he
could impregnate his own two daughters (Gen. 19:31-36)</P>
<P>One of Jacob's sons had sex with one of his father's concubines (making him
a mother-in-law-#u@%er) (Gen. 35:22)</P>
<P>King David's son, Absalom had sex with ten of his father's concubines
(mistresses) in a special tent he erected on top of the palace so that all of
Israel would know what he &quot;knew.&quot; (2 Sam. 16:21-22)</P>
<P>Another of King David's sons, Amnon, had sex with his brother Absalom's
sister (his own half sister). Raping her when she refused to have sex with him,
he then became disgusted with her and kicked her out. (2 Sam. 13:1-17)</P>
<HR>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="polygamy"><U>Too Much is
Always Better Than Not Enough</U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>Much to the disappointment of modern Christians, the Bible teaches that a
man can marry as many women as he can support (Exodus 21:10-11, Deut. 21:15)
and nowhere does it limit the number of women that a man can marry to only one
(Of course a woman can only marry one man...sorry ladies.). The men of the
Bible took full advantage of this state of affairs, often having numerous
wives, as well as sex slaves or &quot;concubines.&quot; The word concubine
comes from the Latin meaning &quot;one to lie with&quot; and the Hebrew word
for concubine means a woman bought as a slave or otherwise acquired by a man
for his sexual pleasure, or to serve as a surrogate childbearer if his wife, or
one of his wives, was barren. In the Bible, a father had the right to sell his
daughter to be one of these sex slaves (Exodus 21:7-9) God used concubines as a
source of offspring throughout the Bible. The Father of God's chosen people,
Abraham had sex with his wife's handmaid (Gen. 16:4) and the fathers of several
of the tribes of Israel came from Jacob having sex with his wives' handmaids
(See <A HREF="#jacob">Sex, Drugs and Husband Swapping</A> Gen. 30:4-5, 7, 9-12)
</P>
<P>Polygamy or having more than one wife was practiced by such popular biblical
heros as Abraham (Gen. 16:1-11), Jacob (Gen. 29:28, 30:4,9,26), King David (2
Sam. 2:2, 5:13, 12:8-9, Abijah (2 Chron. 13:21), Jehoiada (2 Chron. 24:3),
Gideon (Judges 8:30) and of course the wise King Solomon with his seven hundred
wives and three hundred concubines (1 Kings 11:1-4). Mormons were persecuted by
Bible-believing Christians in the United States for attempting to continue this
practice which God had established in his &quot;good&quot; book.</P>
<HR>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="rape"><U>Forced
Entry</U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>The Bible has numerous stories which involve rape. Lot was willing to turn
his daughters over to a rape mob to protect himself and some extraterrestrial
visitors (Genesis 19:4-8). Lot's daughters later raped HIM by using a drug
(alcohol) to incapacitate him and then forced him to have sex without his
knowledge or consent (Gen. 19:33, 35). </P>
<P>Jacob's only daughter, Dinah was raped by a member of a heathen tribe who
then tried to strike a deal with Jacob for her hand in marriage. This deal
involved all the men of the tribe having to become circumcised (Gen. 34:2-4 -
See<A HREF="#circumcise">Sexual Mutilation</A>). </P>
<P>As we already mentioned, Amnon also raped his sister Tamar who then tried to
get him to marry her and he refused (2 Sam. 13:11-15).</P>
<P>Dealing with a rapist by offering him your daughter's hand in marriage might
seem barbaric to modern readers but the Bible says that if you raped a woman
who wasn't already betrothed (engaged or promised to someone) all he had to do
was pay her father a fee and she had to marry her rapist (Exodus 22:16-17,
Deut. 22:28-29). Rape was also legal if a man was at war and saw a foreign
woman that he wanted. According to the law, all he had to do was capture her
and take her home, shave her head, trim her nails and strip her naked. After 30
days of captivity he could consider her his wife and if she didn't please him
he was free to kick her out. Nowhere does it mention getting the woman's
consent (Deut. 21:10-14). </P>
<P>One of the more disgusting Bible stories tells of a man who was traveling
through the land of the Benjamites (one of the tribes of Israel) with his
concubine and was staying at an old man's house when a gang of men came to the
house and demanded that the man turn himself over to the mob so they could rape
him. The old man tried to dissuade them from raping his guest by offering the
mob his own virgin daughter and the other man's concubine instead. The crowd
decides to take the man's concubine after which they proceed to rape and abuse
her all night long. When dawn comes they release her and she drags herself back
to the old man's house, dying on the front step. The man comes out and sees her
laying on the doorstep and tells her &quot;Get up, let's get going,&quot; but
she is dead. So the man carries her dead body back home and cuts her up into 12
pieces and then sends those pieces all across the country just to show how
horribly he had been treated while he was a guest of the Benjaminites (Judges
19:16-29). As a result of the outrage this inspires, the tribe of Benjamin is
practically exterminated, leaving only a few hundred men to survive. This type
of injustice is common in the Bible. God often set the example by punishing
entire groups when he was angry rather than punishing the individuals who
actually commited the crime.</P>
<HR>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="prostitution"><U>The
Oldest Profession</U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>Women in the Bible were often forced to resort to prostitution in an attempt
to equal the balance of power which men had over them. Women in Hebrew society
were considered valuable only for their ability to provide offspring. If a
woman had no offspring or husband to care for her, she ended up picking through
refuse for scraps to stay alive (as Ruth was forced to do - See
<A HREF="#women">The Weaker Sex</A>). An example of a woman driven to
prostitution because of the patriarchal culture of the Hebrews can be found in
the story of Tamar (See the Anti-Tract <A HREF="bfv_1.html">Biblical Family
Values</A>). Tamar became a prostitute to trick her father in-law into making
her pregnant and giving her a child (Gen. 38:14-18).</P>
<IMG SRC="jericho.jpeg" ALT="The whore of Jericho" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="259"
 HEIGHT="367" BORDER="0"> <P>Another famous biblical prostitute lived in the
city of Jericho and was the madam of one of the local whorehouses. This is the
same Jericho that Joshua made famous by causing its walls to &quot;come
tumbling down.&quot; Rahab, the prostitute was hiding two Hebrew spies in her
whorehouse (I'm sure they only slept there!) and provided them with a hiding
place in exchange for the safety of herself and her family during the upcoming
Hebrew invasion. Just as he had done in the other cities he invaded, the
heartless slayer Joshua killed every man, woman, child, infant, ox, sheep and
ass in the city (Joshua 6:21) yet he spared Rahab and her family as he had
promised (Joshua 6:22-25). It's interesting that of the thousands of lives this
bloodthirsty barbarian took with the sword, it is a traitorous prostitute which
would gain his mercy. (See <A HREF="bloody.html">The Bloody Bible)</A></P>
<P>One of the more famous characters in the Bible had an addiction to
prostitutes but God didn't seem to mind until one cut his hair for him. This
character was Samson of course. Samson slept with numerous prostitutes even
after he was married but for some strange reason he remained in God's good
graces until Delilah cut off his magical locks of hair (Judges 16:1, 4) See
<A HREF="stories.html">Bible Stories You Won't Hear In Sunday School</A>).</P>
<P>One of the most popular children's Bible stories is the story of the
&quot;wise&quot; King Solomon and how he determined who the mother of a child
was. In the story, two women had children in the same house and one of the
children died. The mother of the dead child tried to claim that the living
child were hers. To determine who the mother was, the king threatened to cut it
into two pieces and give one half to each mother. The real mother, responded in
horror that the king should give the child to the other woman and not kill it
(1 Kings 3:16-27). What isn't told too often is the fact that the two mothers
who brought the child before the king, were prostitutes, and the child was a
bastard. King Solomon's intentions to &quot;cut the child in two pieces&quot;
may not have been as much a stroke of genius on his part as it was a cruel
reaction of the king to the illegitimate child and its mother's profession.</P>
<P>In one Bible story, God commands a man to marry a whore, in direct violation
of his previous commandment not to do that very thing (Lev. 21:7). This woman
continues to commit her adulterous acts even though the man begs her to stop.
He finally gets so fed up with her actions that he sells her into slavery, but
his &quot;love&quot; for her causes him to change his mind and he buys her back
out of slavery (Hosea 1:1-3, 2:1-5, 14-15, 3:1-3,). Some claim this is an
allegory of God and how his chosen people treated him. </P>
<P>It appears that God has a special place in his hearts for prostitutes and
whores as he often compared his chosen people to a whore who was taken by a man
in marriage but kept going back to have sex with other men. The passage we
quoted in <A HREF="#sextalk">Biblical Sex Talk</A> was of God comparing Israel
to two sisters who couldn't get enough sex. The following are a modern day
translations of how God metaphorically described his chosen people and what he
thought of them.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>Jeremiah 3:1-6</I></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> There isn't any place in all the land that you haven't defiled by
committing adultery against me. You sit like a whore alongside the road waiting
for a customer to come along. You are like a faithless wife who gives herself
freely to other men everytime she gets the chance. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>Ezekiel 16:1-60</I></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> When I first saw you, you were still covered with blood and your
umbilical cord had not as yet been cut. That same day of your birth, you were
dumped into a field and left there to die until I came along and adopted you as
my very own. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As you reached puberty, your breasts became well-rounded and your
pubic hair began to grow fully, yet as far as I was concerned, you were still
as naked as you were the day you were born. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I married you and you became mine legally, but then you began
giving yourself freely as a prostitute to every Tom, Dick and Harry who passed
by. All any man had to do to have you for his own was to ask you. And during
all these many years of playing the whore against me, you never have stopped to
think about that day of your birth when I first saw you still covered with the
blood from your mother's womb. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You have gone ahead and built a spacious brothel and in that house
you have offered to spread your legs for every man who came along. You have, in
fact, been so eager to go to bed with every man available that you have not
even charged for your services and for this reason, you are far worse than an
ordinary prostitute who at least charges for her services and makes her living
thereby. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But I will still have my revenge against you. I will personally
knock down all your bordellos and strip you naked and embarrass you before all
your lovers. You will be fully repaid for your unfaithfulness and then,
although you don't deserve it, I will take you back as my wife and forgive you
for everything that you have done.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>Ezekiel 23</I></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(In this allegory, God's chosen people had been divided into two
kingdoms and God compares the two kingdoms to two sisters named Oholah and
Oholibah, who have become prostitutes)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Both of you sisters have become my wives. You, Oholah, the older
sister, and you, Oholibah, the younger one, have become infatuated with the
Assyrians, our neighbors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You have found these attractive young men to be irresistible and
you have gone to bed with captains, commanders and many other soldiers dashing
about on their horses and wearing handsome blue uniforms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Oholibah, you have become so thoroughly depraved that you have even
fallen in love with painted pictures which you saw on a wall. They were
pictures of Babylonian military officers and you were so sexually aroused by
looking at these pictures, that in your imagination, you were already giving
yourself freely to the men in the pictures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You finally sent messengers to Chaldea to invite the officers whom
the pictures represented to come to you in person and you went to bed with them
fornicating freely, although, after your brief affair was over, you hated them
and broke off with them immediately.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Oholibah, like your older sister Oholah, you started your life of
sexual promiscuity as a young girl when you were still in Egypt and the lovers
you had there had penises as big as those of jackasses shooting as much semen
as horses shoot.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But I will soon stop both of you sisters from longing for Egypt and
the many lovers you had to leave behind there. You will be fully repaid for
whoring and then you will know who I really am. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The prophet, Jeremiah, went so far as to compare Israel with a female
jackass in heat, a disgusting sight indeed (Jeremiah 2:24).</P>
<P>In the Book of Revelations, it is Babylon which is compared to a whore that
has had sexual relations with the kings of the earth and who has made the
people of the earth &quot;drunk with the wine of her fornication&quot;
(Revelations 17:1-9, 19:1-2).</P>
<P>Couldn't a virtuous and perfect God come up with allegories that were less
obscene than these?</P>
<HR>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="circumcise"><U>Sexual
Mutilation</U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>When God decided to make a deal with man and chose Abraham to be the father
of his chosen people, God felt it necessary to seal the deal in blood, but not
just ANY blood. God wanted blood from man's sex organ. There is something very
suspicious about a God who demands that you cut off a part of your penis as a
sacrifice to show your dedication to him. The circumcision of male children was
done as a form of human blood sacrifice to God. This purification sacrifice of
human blood allowed the mother to be cleansed of her &quot;unclean blood&quot;
at 40 days instead of the 80 days a female birth required (See
<A HREF="#discharge">Dirty, Disgusting Discharges</A>).</P>
<P> God's obsession with the male foreskin appears in various places in the
Bible. He even went so far as to demand that any boy child who didn't have his
foreskin cut off would be &quot;cut off (pun intended?) from his people.&quot;
(Gen. 17:14) God intended to carry out this threat by killing Moses because his
son had not been circumcised (Exodus 4:24), but the wife of Moses grabbed a
sharp stone and cut her son's foreskin off (ouch) first and threw it down at
Moses &quot;feet&quot; (genitals?) calling him a &quot;bloody husband&quot;
(Exodus 4:25-26).</P>
<P>When God's people wandered the desert for 40 years under Moses and Joshua's
leadership, the ritual of circumcision was temporarily suspended, but God never
totally called for a halt to the bloody practice. God commanded Joshua to make
sharp knives and circumcise ALL the boys and men, which he did (Joshua 5:1-9). 
</P>
<P>After Shechem, a member of a heathen tribe, raped Jacob's only daughter, he
&quot;fell in love&quot; with her and wanted her for his wife. Shechem's father
went to Jacob to attempt to make peace between the two tribes by offering a
dowry of any amount which Jacob would ask for his daughter's hand in marriage.
Jacob's sons deceptively told the heathens that the only way the two families
could be joined would be if all the male members of the heathen tribe became
circumcised. The leader of the heathen tribe was able to convince all the men
to get circumcised in compliance with the demands of Jacob's sons. While the
men were layed up recovering from the painful operation, Jacob's sons went into
their camp and murdered all the men, taking the women, children, cattle and
property for themselves. In typical Godly fashion they &quot;avenged&quot; the
rape of their sister by killing an entire group of people who had nothing to do
with the rape (Genesis 34:1-29). Shechem had done nothing which was in
violation of Hebrew law (See <A HREF="#rape">Forced Entry</A>), he had offered
to pay the required fee and intended to keep his end of the bargain. The rest
of the tribe made an act of faith which was brutally betrayed by God's chosen
people. The only thing that Jacob worried about after this event was that the
reputation of his tribe would be damaged in the local area and the other tribes
would hunt him down and destroy him (Genesis 34:30-31). There is no mention of
God's disapproval of the treacherous actions of Jacob's sons.</P>
<P>King Saul was jealous of David but realized that God was protective of him
so he devised a plan to get rid of David by having him killed in battle (See
<A HREF="bloody.html">The Bloody Bible</A>). King Saul told David that he
wanted him to be his son-in-law and marry his daughter. Since David was poor,
King Saul told him that he would accept a &quot;special&quot; dowry for his
daughter's hand. All David had to do was kill one hundred Philistines and bring
the king their foreskins as the dowry. David zealously killed twice that number
of Philistines and cut the foreskins off their penises and brought them to King
Saul (1 Samuel 18:20-27). The image of such a disgusting spectacle should be
enough to turn the stomach of any self-respecting person, yet millions continue
to embrace the Bible as being the word of God. But then it also doesn't seem to
bother them that this is the same God who demanded that his followers cut off a
piece of their penis to show their loyalty to him.</P>
<P>Even though God discriminated against those who had been wounded in their
testicles (&quot;stones&quot;) or had their penises (&quot;privy&quot;) cut off
(Deuteronomy 23:1), Jesus taught that some people would castrate themselves for
God (Matthew 19:12). God told the prophet Isaiah that those who were castrated
would get a better place in heaven than those who could have children (Isaiah
56:3-5).</P>
<P>Paul attempted to put an end to the practice of circumcision to make
Christianity more attractive to pagan converts who weren't too anxious to have
their foreskins whacked off (1 Corinthians 7:18-19, Galatians 5:2-6). It's
amazing that Paul could rationalize away what God called &quot;an everlasting
covenant&quot; when Jesus was himself circumcised and never hinted during his
life that the everlasting covenant of circumcision were to be done away with.
In fact Jesus specifically forbade what Paul did (Matthew 5:17-19). Paul became
the greatest &quot;antichrist&quot; by doing away with the law of circumcision
(2 John 19-10), and today, Christianity is largely based on the teachings of
this &quot;antichrist.&quot;</P>

<P>The Bible tells us that God thinks that any discharge from the sex organs is
unclean. Primitive man believed that when a woman had a menstrual cycle, she
was getting rid of &quot;bad blood.&quot; God apparently believed the same
thing because, according to God's laws, a woman who was on her menstrual cycle
was considered &quot;unclean&quot; for seven days. This uncleanliness was
apparently contagious, since anyone who touched her while she was on her period
was also considered unclean (Leviticus 15:19). In another passage, the Bible
states that if a man has sex with a woman on her period, both he and the bed
they did it on will be unclean (Leviticus 15:24). Later in the chapter this
uncleanliness was considered to be so bad that the death penalty was demanded
for any couple who had sexual intercourse while the woman was having her period
(Leviticus 18:19, 20:18). Not only people, but things could catch this
uncleanliness, including everything she layed on or sat on. And if anyone
touched something which she layed or sat on, that person was also considered to
be unclean (Leviticus 15:20-28). While she was unclean, the menstruating woman
had to participate in purification rites, staying isolated and hidden, often
outside the city or camp, until she had cleaned her menstrual rags. After the
menstruating woman had completed her seven days of purification rites, she was
required to bring two animals, for a burnt offering and a sin offering, to the
priest, to atone for her &quot;sin&quot; of uncleanliness. The New Testament
also mentions how a woman with a twelve year long menstrual flow (probably as a
result of veneral disease due to its description -see Mark 5:26) was healed
after she touched Jesus' garment (Matt. 9:20, Mark 5:25-29, Luke 8:43). It's
amazing to think that any educated person would believe that the creator of all
the universe would exhibit such ignorance concerning the natural reproductive
function of the female body.</P>
<P>God's word tells us that the very act of conception is &quot;sin&quot;
(Psalms 51:3-5) and that when a woman conceives, it is in sin. It also said
that God made childbirth painful as a form of punishment (Genesis 3:16).
Believers rationalize that Eve's reproductive functions were cursed because Eve
succumbed to temptation and partook of the fruit of the tree of knowledge in
the garden of Eden. Ask any woman today what she did to deserve pain and
suffering during childbirth. If she is a rational human, she will tell you that
nothing that any of her ancestors did should condemn her to a life of
suffering. For some reason, God decided to tell Moses that the miraculous and
beautiful act of childbirth makes a woman &quot;unclean&quot; (Leviticus
12:1-8). Again it is the blood which accompanies the birth which supposedly
makes her unclean (Lev. 12:7). If she delivered a male child she was considered
unclean for 40 days and if she delivered a female child she would be unclean
for 80 days. As we stated earlier, it was probably the blood sacrifice of human
flesh (circumcision) that her shortened her period of uncleanliness, although
some experts have theorized that the difference may have been due to the
increased value of a male child over a female in Hebrew society. </P>
<P>Women weren't the only ones with unclean discharges in the Bible. A man's
&quot;issue&quot; or seminal discharge was considered &quot;unclean.&quot;
According to God's laws, after engaging in sexual intercourse, both the man and
the woman were supposed to clean the semen off themselves with water. Even
after doing that they were considered unclean for the rest of that day
(Leviticus 15:18). Moses went so far as to command the men in his group to keep
clean by washing their clothes and not having sex with their wives for three
days (Exodus 19:14-15).</P>
<P>Ejaculation, whether by masturbation or nocturnal emission was considered to
be dirty by God, who lumped it in the same category as handling rotten meat
(Leviticus 22:4-7). If a man masturbated and his ejaculate got on his clothes
or the carpet, those things had to be washed and were also considered unclean
until the evening (Leviticus 15:16-17). Also, if a man had a wet dream, he had
to leave the camp and couldn't come back in until the next evening (Deuteronomy
23:10-11). What a sticky situation to be in!</P>
<P>Onan, the second husband of Tamar, (See <A HREF="bfv_1.html">Biblical Family
Values</A>), was killed by God as a punishment for refusing to impregnate his
dead brother's wife by pulling out of her vagina and ejaculating on the ground
(Genesis 38:1-10). Many modern Christians mistakenly use this passage to claim
that masturbation is a sin, thinking that Onan merely ejaculated on the ground.
What they fail to realize is that Onan was having sex with Tamar when his
&quot;seed&quot; was spilled on the ground. More evidence that the Bible is not
completely read by those who claim to believe it is God's Word. This is another
one of those Bible stories that you won't hear too often in Sunday School.</P>
<P>Another cause for a man to have an &quot;unclean&quot; discharge came as a
result of veneral disease. The Bible describes gonorrhea as &quot;a running
issue&quot; and says that any man who has it is unclean. It then proceeds to
describe how everything that he lies or sits on is unclean and how anyone who
touches him, his bed or sits on anything he has sat on is unclean and how
anything that was under him is unclean and his saddle is unclean and any pot
that he touches must be destroyed. Finallly it says that once his &quot;running
issue&quot; has stopped running, he must clean himself for seven days, then
give a sacrificial offering to atone for his disease (Leviticus 15:1-15). A
priest who has gonorrhea was also unable to eat any of the holy food which
priests ate, until his disease was cleared up (Leviticus 22:4). King David once
described himself as having a condition which was probably syphilis, but could
have been some other veneral disease (Psalms 38:3-8).</P>

<P>Even though the Bible has numerous references to homosexual activity, many
Christians believe that God hates fags (See <A
HREF="http://godhatesfags.com/">http://godhatesfags.com/</A>). Of course they
often ignore the fact that Jesus participated in what could only be called
&quot;man-boy love&quot; and one of God's most favored men, King David, was a
&quot;flaming fag&quot; himself. We at the Luciferian Liberation Front allow
all men the liberty to pursue their own rational self interest in the manner
which is natural for them. We believe that homosexuality is not so much a
life-style choice as it is a natural genetic mutation. As such, homosexuals
should be allowed to live their lives in the manner which is natural for them,
so long as they harm no one. If God hates fags, then he never should have made
the potential for genetic diversity. Christians are afraid to learn that
homosexuality is due to genetics because that makes it God's fault. Ask the
next one you see why God makes Down's Syndrome children or any other genetic
mutation, and they'll duck and dodge, falling back behind the curtain of
&quot;the mysteries of God.&quot; </P>
<P>The biblically famous David had a homosexual relationship with King Saul's
son, Jonathan. When they first met, they became &quot;soulmates&quot; in an
encounter best described as &quot;love at first site&quot; (1 Samuel 18:1-5).
Jonathon loved David even more than his own father, putting himself in harm's
way to protect the life of his lover, David (1 Samuel 19:1-7). King Saul became
jealous of David and was determined to kill him. This made Jonathan so upset
that he couldn't eat. Jonathan then snuck off to a field to lay with David,
holding him in his arms, kissing and weeping like the lovesick couple they were
(1 Samuel 20:31-42). When Jonathan's father, King Saul, found out about the
homosexual affair, he confronted Jonathan with the fact that he knew that he
was gay and then he blamed it on Jonathan's mother, calling her
&quot;perverse&quot; and &quot;rebellious&quot; (1 Samuel 20:30). Later when
Jonathan died, David admited that [Jonathan's] &quot;love to me was wonderful,
passing the love of women.&quot; (2 Samuel 1:25-26)</P>
<P>The Bible claims that homosexuality was a punishment which God gave to those
who worshipped idols or commited other forms of blasphemy. (Romans 1:18-27). 
</P>
<P>Indeed the Bible is full of anti-homosexual laws, claiming that homosexuals
are in the same class as thieves and murderers (1 Corinthians 6:9-11, 1 Timothy
1:8-11, Leviticus 18:22, 20:13).</P>
<P>The Bible even condems cross-dressing, calling transvestites an abomination!
(Deuteronomy 22:5)</P>
<P>Jesus' homosexual activity has been demonstrated in modern theater and
cinema and can be traced to actual biblical passages. From the modern Christian
model, we can assume that Jesus loved all of his disciples, yet the Bible
specifically describes one disciple as &quot;the disciple that Jesus
loved&quot; (John 19:26, 20:2, 21:7,20). This disciple is described as
&quot;lying on Jesus' breast&quot; at the last supper (John 13:23, 25). What
Jesus did with this specific disciple to earn him the title &quot;the disciple
that Jesus loved&quot; can only be imagined but it's not too difficult to get a
pretty clear picture seeing them snuggling with each other in public. Jesus
himself was a homo. This is further supported by scriptures which describe
Jesus displaying inappropriate behavior for a man to be showing to other men,
such as lust (Mark 10:21), suggesting that men should be kissing him (Luke
7:45), describing men sharing the same bed (Luke 17:34), etc. </P>
<P>When Jesus was in the garden of Gethsemane, he left his disciples who were
sleeping and went off, returning several times to check on them (Mark
14:37-41). When Jesus came back after the third time, there was a young man
following him with only a linen cloth wrapped around his naked body. When the
guards tried to grab the young man after grabbing Jesus, the young man dropped
the cloth and ran off naked (Mark 14:51-52). Who was this scantily clad young
streaker and why was he returning with Jesus? What had Jesus REALLY been doing
with a naked young man that night in the garden? The &quot;Secret Gospel of
Mark&quot;, known from early Church father, Clement of Alexandria's (150-230
C.E.) letter to Theodorus contains excerpts which include the following</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;...the young man, looking at Jesus, loved him and began to
beseech him that he might be with him...they went into the house of the young
man, for he was rich. And the young man, looking at Jesus, loved him...and
after six days Jesus gave him an order; and when the evening had come, the
young man went to him, dressed with a linen cloth over his naked body. And he
remained with him that night, because Jesus taught him the mystery of the
kingdom of God.&quot;(Secret Gospel of Mark). </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> What exactly is this &quot;mystery&quot; of the kingdom of God that Jesus
spent all night showing the scantily clad young man? This very suggestive
passage was inserted in the canon of the orthodox Alexandrian Church of Egypt.
Some scholars say that it should be inserted in our modern Bible after Mark
10:34. The naked man incident is always left out of Easter pagents for some
strange reason.</P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="adultery"><U>Take My
Wife...PLEASE!</U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>Bible-thumpers love to scream about the evils of marital infidelity but seem
to ignore the many instances of adultery and mate-swapping which took palce
among God's favored people. </P>
<P>One of God's Ten Commandments states &quot;Thou shalt not commit
adultery.&quot; (Exodus 20:14). The punishment for committing adultery was
death (Leviticus 20:10). If a man suspected that his wife had committed
adultery there was a test that could be performed to determine whether she had
been faithful or not. If the suspecting man brought the priest an offering
(bribe) then the priest would mix a concoction of water and dirt from off the
floor of the temple which he would make the woman drink. If the woman got sick
after drinking the water, it was because she had committed adultery. If she was
innocent she would then be able to get pregnant (Numbers 5:11-31). Fortunately,
modern forensics doesn't rely on such superstitious hogwash to determine
fidelity or paternity.</P>
<P>One of the more popular biblical incidence of adultery took place when King
David saw a woman washing out her menstrual rags in the fountain outside his
palace. The king asked who she was and one of his servants told him that she
was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, one of the soldiers in King David's army. The
king then sent his messengers to take her and bring her to his bedroom (2
Samuel 11:2-4). This woman knew that it was out of the question for her to
resist the advances of the king so she submitted to his demands and when he was
done having sex with her, she went back to her home. Meanwhile, her husband was
fighting for his king and country. Soon Bathsheba discovered that the king has
made her pregnant. When the king finds out she is pregnant he devises a plan to
have her husband come back from the war and stay with his wife, in this way the
king hoped that Uriah would think that he had gotten his wife pregnant and
wouldn't suspect the king (2 Samuel 11:5-9). After Uriah returned from the war
he tells the king that he couldn't put his own pleasure and comfort first by
going home while his comrades in arms were still fighting so he stayed at the
palace until it was time for him to return to the war (2 Samuel 11:10-12). This
foiled the king's plans to cover up the pregnancy so King David adopted the
plans which King Saul had attempted to use to dispose of David when he was
younger, he sent Uriah into the fiercest part of a battle and had his commander
abandon him so that he would be killed by the enemy (2 Samuel 11:15). In this
manner, King David disposed of the husband of the woman that he had gotten
pregnant. After she learned that her husband was dead, Bathsheba mourned for
him until King David had her brought to the castle to become one of his wives
(2 Samuel 11:26-27). God was not pleased with King David's actions in this
incident and in typical Godly fashion he punished the innocent child which
David had created as a result of his adultery. God claimed that he would
forgive David of this deed but now God's enemies would now have a chance to
make fun of God. Because of God's childish pride, the baby would have to die (2
Samuel 12:13-14). After the child was tortured by God for seven days, it
finally died (2 Samuel 12:18) and King David immediately went to comfort his
new wife Bathsheba. He did this by having sex with her (surprise) and created a
second child which &quot;the Lord loved,&quot; the wise King Solomon. (2 Samuel
12:24). King David's servants were shocked at the fact that while the baby lie
sick and suffering, King David mourned, but as soon as the child died, the King
got up, ate and went right in to do what caused all this to begin with. David
replied that while the child was alive he hoped to influence God to not kill
the child, but once the child died he knew that he couldn't bring it back. In
other words, &quot;why cry over spilled milk?&quot; (2 Samuel 12:21-23) God
later called this same King David, &quot;a man after my own heart&quot; (Acts
13:22).</P>
<P>The prophet Nathan told King David that one day God would give David's own
wives to another man who would go to bed with them in full public view to shame
David before his own people (2 Samuel 12:11-12). Little did the king realize
that the man who would do this would be his own son, Absalom (See
<A HREF="#incest">Incest is Best</A>).</P>
<P>When Joseph was sold into slavery as a result of jealousy (which his father
had created by loving Joseph more than his other children) at the age of
seventeen, he gained favor with the captain of Pharoh's guards, but he gained
even greater favor with that captain's wife. She tried to get Joseph to have
sex with her but to his credit, he refused. The woman tore Joseph's garment off
of him as he tried to escape from her clutches. In her anger after being
refused by Joseph, she acused him of attempting to rape her. Because of this
deception, Joseph was put in prison (Genesis 39:7-20). A refreshing example of
someone respecting another man's property (women were considered to be property
- See <A HREF="#women">The Weaker Sex</A>) and doing the morally correct thing
in the Bible!</P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="expose"><U>Indecent
Exposure</U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>The first thing Adam and Eve did when they partook of the fruit of the
knowledge of good and evil was try to hide their nakedness. Apparently, God had
no problem with them running around in the garden naked while they were
ignorant, but once he realized that they knew better, God made them clothes to
wear (Genesis 3:21).</P>
<P>After Noah got off the ark, he got rip-roaring drunk and fell asleep with
his genitals exposed. One of Noah's sons saw that he was laying naked and went
and told his two brothers about it. His two brothers went in and covered Noah's
exposed genitals without looking at them. After Noah found out that his son had
seen him naked, Noah administered typical godly justice by punishing the son of
the son who had seen him naked, cursing him to be a &quot;servant of
servants&quot; to his brothers (Genesis 9:21-25). Noah's son may have been
guilty of more than simply seeing his father naked because the Bible states
that when Noah woke up he &quot;knew what his younger son had done unto
him.&quot; (Genesis 9:24) We can only speculate as to what really took place
between the drunken, naked Noah and his son.</P>
<P>God's aversion to the naked human body was so great that he gave special
instructions to his priests to be careful not to expose their genitals when
walking up to the altar (Exodus 20:26).</P>
<P>When Moses came down from the mount with the Ten Commandments he saw the
people dancing in the nude before the golden calf and had 3,000 of them
slaughtered (Exodus 32:25-28).</P>
<P>God doesn't seem to mind nakedness if the naked person is prophesying,
though. The prophet Micah stripped himself naked and wailed and howled,
prophesying in the nude (Micah 1:8).</P>
<P>God commanded the prophet Isaiah to strip himself and walk naked across
Egypt and Ethiopia for THREE YEARS, prophesying in the nude. God then said that
the Egyptians and Ethiopians would following Isaiah's example by being led away
captive by the king of Assyria &quot;naked and barefoot, even with their
buttocks uncovered to the shame of Egypt&quot; (Isaiah 20:1-4)</P>
<P>King Saul displayed the same lack of modesty with his own body while under
God's direction. Once he was overcome by the spirit of the Lord and he stripped
himself naked and prophesied in the nude. Then he layed on the ground, naked
for the rest of the day and that night. The people who saw it were only
surprised that Saul was prophesying, probably because they were used to seeing
prophets expose themselves (1 Samuel 19:20-24).</P>
<P>King David was also an exhibitionist who flashed his royal subjects with his
royal &quot;staff.&quot; After returning home from acquiring the ark of the
covenant, King David danced in the streets and exposed himself in front of his
own servants' handmaids (2 Samuel 6:14-16). When his wife witnessed his
behavior, she accused him of behaving like a common pervert (2 Samuel 6:20). In
his anger, King David told her that what he did was no one's business but his
and the Lord's and that if she thought <I>that</I> behavior was vile, she
hadn't seen ANYTHING yet! He then told her that he would be even more vile and
the women servants who she had spoken of would honor him (2 Samuel 6:22). The
Bible then tells us that his wife was childless because she dared to speak out
against David's behavior (2 Samuel 6:23). Whether this was because the King
refused to have sex with her or because God had made her barren is not made
clear.</P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="sacredsex"><U>Sacred

<P>The Jews were surrounded by pagan fertility religions which worshipped the
sex organs. Many of the biblical references to the worship of the penis or the
vulva have been camouflaged in the usual method of mistranslation. The pagans
would construct graven images of penises which the Bible described as
&quot;high places&quot; or &quot;pillars&quot; and the yoni or female sex
organs which was translated as &quot;grove&quot; (a reference to the bushy
appearance of female pubic hair). Knowing the hidden meanings, we can now
visualize the wooden and stone statues of giant penises and larger-than-life
vaginas which were erected &quot;on every high hill and under every green
tree&quot; across the land during the reigns of Saul, David, Solomon and his
son Rehoboam (1 Kings 14:22-24). </P>
<P>The grandson of Rehoboam, King Asa attempted to destroy the worship of these
phallic idols and he even kicked his mother off the throne because she had made
an idol of a giant penis inside a giant vagina. He destroyed this particular
pornographic idol but for some reason he didn't destroy the giant penises (1
Kings 15:11-14). </P>
<P>These phallic idols had even found their way into the main temple in
Jerusalem. A giant Yoni had been erected inside the sanctuary. Women who lived
near the temple made a living weaving artificial pubic hair which people could
purchase to hang on this large representation of the female sex organ as a form
of personal worship, sort of like modern Catholics who place candles at altars
today. All the fun was eventually ended by King Josiah who had the Yoni taken
out and destroyed. He even destroyed the houses of the women who made the
hangings for the Yoni (2 Kings 23:6-7). </P>
<P>The giant penises and vaginas that were erected outdoors were so popular
that many kept smaller versions of them in their homes or carried them with
them like modern Christians carry small replicas of Jesus being tortured to
death on a cross. These smaller idols were called &quot;household gods&quot; or
in the Hebrew; &quot;ephods&quot; and &quot;teraphim (Judges 17:5) and were
replicas of erect penises and gaping vaginas. </P>
<P>These household gods played an interesting role in the story of Jacob in the
Bible. Jacob married Leah and her sister Rachel, who were daughters of the
pagan, Laban (See <A HREF="#jacob">Sex, Drugs and Husband Swapping</A>). When
Jacob left Laban's house, his wife Rachel stole her father's idols and hid
them. Once Laban discovered that his precious sex idols were missing, he
tracked down Jacob and demanded that they be returned. Jacob didn't know that
his wife had stolen these idols so he was enraged at the accusation. When Laban
searched in the tent of Rachel for the missing idols, Rachel pretended like she
was on her monthly menstrual period so that Laban wouldn't come near her (See
<A HREF="#discharge">Dirty, Disgusting Discharges</A>). Laban was unable to
find the idols because Rachel was SITTING ON THEM (Genesis 31:19-35).
Apparently Rachel had such a fondness for these sacred dildos that she couldn't
bare to part with them!</P>
<P>Apparently, both the men and women of Israel were guilty of participating in
the pagan sex rituals, orgies and debaucheries which took place in these
fertility religions. Numerous times in the Bible, God got angry at his people
for joining their neighbors in practicing the worship of the phallus and the
yoni. Even today, the remnants of these fertility religions haunt Christianity
(See <A HREF="sf_1.html">Something Fishy</A>). </P>
<P>As we've already mentioned, Moses witnessed his people participating in one
of these mass sex orgies after he first received the 10 Commandments (Exodus
32:25-28). </P>
<P>When Moses led the Hebrews out of bondage in Egypt, they met up with a
kingdom of Midianites who lured the men into their sex worship. When God saw
his people having sex with the Midianite women and bowing down to their phallic
idols, he commanded Moses to cut off the heads of all the men who had
participated in the sex worship with Midianite women and to hang their heads
out in the sun (Numbers 25:1-5). While Moses was carrying out God's bloody
commandment, one of the Hebrew men was spotted taking a Midianite woman into
his tent to have sex with her. The grandson of Aaron, the priest, saw this and
took a spear and went in and drove it straight through both the man and the
woman while they were having sex (Numbers 25:6-8). God was pleased with the
actions of the spear-chucker and gave him an everlasting priesthood because of
his murderous zeal. After the spear was thrown, God called off the plague that
he had cursed Israel with. This plague had taken the lives of 24,000 Israelites
because of God's &quot;jealousy&quot; (Numbers 25:9-11). Now God turned his
wrath on the women who had tempted his chosen people with their sexual
&quot;wiles,&quot; as God put it (Numbers 25:16-18). As a result of this
crusade, 5 kingdoms of Midianites were slain (See <A HREF="arss_1.html">A
Really Scary Story</A>).</P>
<P>This wasn't the last time the Hebrews bowed down and bent over for pagan sex
worship. When Gideon became the ruler in Israel, he erected a golden penis
(ephod) which the people began to &quot;whore&quot; after (Judges 8:27). After
Gideon died, the people turned back to the worship of the sex gods in full
force (Judges 8:33-35). The prophet Hosea described the drunken debaucheries of
the Israelites in detail, telling how they were consorting with animals for
revelation and how their women were having sex with everyone they met (Hosea
4:11-16). The prophet Amos told of a situation where a father and son would
share the same woman in sexual worship (Amos 2:6-8)</P>
<P>With all of these sex organs being worshipped by God's chosen people, we can
see why God compared them to a prostitute and commanded them not to go
&quot;whoring&quot; after their neighbors' gods (Exodus 34:12-16 - Also see
<A HREF="#prostitution">The Oldest Profession</A>).</P>

<P>The story of Jacob is one of the most morally degrading stories of the
Bible. First off, Jacob and his mother lie and decieve to steal what rightfully
belongs to Jacob's older brother, Esau (Genesis 27:6-30) . To avoid Esau's
justified wrath, Jacob runs off to stay with his uncle (Genesis 27:42-43).
While there, he falls for his uncle's daughter, Rachel (his cousin...again,
incest is best) and he makes a deal with his uncle, Laban, that he will work
for Laban for seven years in return for the hand of Rachel in marriage.
<IMG SRC="jacob.jpeg" ALT="Jacob gets 2 brides" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="350"
 HEIGHT="324" BORDER="0">At the end of the seven years, there is a big wedding
feast after which Laban sends his older daughter Leah to the tent of Jacob.
Jacob has sex with Leah, thinking she is Rachel. When Jacob finds out the he
was tricked, Laban tells him that it is against their customs to marry his
younger daughter off before his older one. He then tells Jacob that if he's
willing to work for seven more years, he'll let Jacob marry Rachel, this time
for SURE. So after a week (the honeymoon period for his marriage to Leah), he
is able to marry Rachel and Jacob has to work for seven more years for Laban
(Genesis 29:15-28). Hebrew law later forbade a man from marrying his wife's
sister but Jacob was able to get away with doing this before God came up with
that law (Leviticus 18:18). </P>
<P>The Bible makes it clear that Rachel was pretty while Leah was merely
&quot;tender-eyed,&quot; and Jacob loved Rachel but hated Leah (Genesis 29:31).
God saw that Jacob loved Rachel but hated Leah so as a form of retaliation, God
made Rachel unable to bear children and God opened Leah's womb and she got
pregnant. A fine example of the ignorant Hebrew belief that God would use his
powers to control the &quot;magical&quot; process of reproduction. Sadly, Leah
realizes that her husband hates her but she hopes that now that she has given
him a son, perhaps his heart will soften and he will finally love her (Genesis
29:32). Unfortunately for Leah, Jacob's hatred of her persists even after she
has a second and a third son for him. By the time she has a fourth son, Leah
has given up on gaining Jacob's love (Genesis 29:35).</P>
<P>In the meantime, Rachel becomes jealous of her sister because God won't let
her get pregnant so she cries out to Jacob &quot;Make me pregnant or I will
die!&quot; (Genesis 30:1) Jacob tells her, &quot;Hey, don't blame me if God has
decided to keep you from getting pregnant!&quot;(Genesis 30:2) even though it
was Jacob's hatred of Leah which caused God to keep Rachel from reproducing. In
her frustration, Rachel sends her handmaid to Jacob so that she can get
pregnant and Rachel will get credit for it. The way this process worked was,
the handmaid would deliver the child while squatting between the legs of her
mistress (in this case, Rachel) and the child would be considered to have come
from the mistress instead of the handmaid. What a crock of nonsense! In this
fashion, Jacob makes Rachel's handmaid pregnant twice and Rachel got credit for
giving Jacob two sons.</P>
<P>By this time, Leah had stopped having children and she saw that Rachel was
getting credit for the children her handmaid had produced with Jacob so she
decides she can play that same game. Leah gives Jacob <I>her</I> handmaid and
he proceeds to get this second handmaid pregnant twice also so Leah now gets
credit for giving Jacob two more sons. Thanks to the patriarchal system of the
Hebrews, the two women were now engaged in an all out fertility race to see who
can give Jacob the most sons. The score so far is Leah:6, Rachel:2.</P>
<P>One of Leah's sons found some mandrakes (a plant whose root was believed to
have fertility enhancing characteristics) while he was working in the field and
he brought them to his mother. When Rachel learned that Leah had possession of
the magical roots of reproduction, she went to Leah and begged her for them,
hoping that with them, she would finally be able to get pregnant herself. Leah
didn't want to give away the roots because she hoped they would help her break
her lapse in fertility, but Rachel, who hadn't had any children yet, was
willing to sell her husband to get them. Rachel was scheduled to have sex with
Jacob that night and she offered to buy the roots from Leah by prostituting
Jacob to her. Leah agreed to the husband swap and when Jacob came home that
night Leah told him &quot;you must come have sex with me because I have bought
you tonight with my mandrakes.&quot; (Genesis 30:16) Jacob didn't object, and
neither did God apparently, because the Bible states that God heard Leah and
let her get pregnant with a fifth son (Genesis 30:17). Then Leah got pregnant a
couple of more times and had another son and a daughter. Rachel had some
catching up to do.</P>
<P>God finally had some pity on poor Rachel and he let her get pregnant and she
gave Jacob a son (Genesis 30:22-24). She was able to give Jacob one more son
but she died in childbirth (Genesis 35:16-20). The final score was: Leah-8 sons
(2 from her handmaid), Rachel-4 sons (2 from her handmaid also). These twelve
sons would become the fathers of the twelve tribes of Israel. God surely works
in mysterious ways!</P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="women"><U>The Weaker
Sex</U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>As can be seen from the sections we've already discussed, women were
mistreated throughout the Bible, being relegated to the status of
&quot;baby-maker&quot; and treated like property to be bought and sold or used
as a shield to protect men from mobs. Numerous books have been written on the
mistreatment of women in history but the Bible provides us with a unique
glimpse into God's attitude toward what we at the Luciferian Liberation Front
consider to be man's better half. </P>
<P>The fact that God considers women to be inferior is made plain throughout
the writings of the Bible. Paul, the true author of Christianity, repeatedly
taught the early followers of Christ that women should stay in their place,
which was subservient to man (1 Corinthians 11:3). He also stated that women
were created for man's use (1 Corinthians 11:8-9), that they should learn in
silence, not asking questions or raising doubts about the authority of men in
public (1 Timothy 2:11-12). He went on to state that women should not speak in
church because that was shameful, since the word of God would never come to a
mere woman. If the woman wanted to learn more about something she had heard in
church, she should ask her husband to explain it to her at home (1 Corinthians
14:34-36). Paul rationalized that it was the woman's fault that man fell from
grace in the garden of Eden, because she was deceived by the serpent, not the
man (1 Timothy 2:14).</P>
<P>Modern Christians love to ignore the teachings of Paul in this matter. The
difference between men and women in Paul's eyes is made quite clear when he
tells men to <I>love</I> their wives while women are commanded to be
<I>submissive</I> and <I>obey</I> their husbands (Ephesians 5:22-23, Colossians
3:18-19 1 Peter 3:1-7). </P>
<P>The fact that women were mere property is made readily apparent by the
manner in which women were treated in the Bible. Fathers could sell their
daughters into slavery (Exodus 21:7), use them for protection from mobs
(Genesis 19:8, Judges 19:24), offer them as rewards for assasins (Joshua
15:16-17), or murder them as a human sacrifice, if God so demands (Judges
11:30-31, 34-40). Men could rape with relative impunity (Exodus 22:16-17, Deut.
22:28-29), taking women or girls as war booty (Numbers 31:17-18, Deut.
21:10-14) and enslaving as many women as he could afford to keep through the
Godly practice of polygamy (Exodus 21:10). </P>
<P>As we pointed out earlier, taking women as property during war was ordained
of God. When God told his people how to properly invade a foreign city, he told
them that if the city didn't surrender peacefully and agree to be slaves, the
Hebrews were to kill all the men in the city and take the women and the rest of
the property for themselves (Deuteronomy 20:10-14). Of course, this guidance
only applied to those cities which were very far away. The cities which God had
given them for an inheritance were to have all living things in them killed
(Deuteronomy 20:15-16). </P>
<P>When the tribe of Benjamin was nearly exterminated (See <A
HREF="#rape">Forced Entry</A>), the leaders of Israel had decreed that they
wouldn't allow any of their women to marry the men of the tribe of Benjamin
(Judges 21:1). Without women, the tribe was doomed to become extinct, so the
leaders of Israel came up with a plan to get wives for the Benjamites (Judges
21:2-4). They called for a council meeting but didn't send out an invitation to
one of the minor tribes. When there were no representatives from that tribe
present at the council meeting (Judges 21:5-9), the leaders declared that the
minor tribe that hadn't shown up would have all of its people that weren't
virgin women of marrying age, slayed (Judges 21:10-11). The surviving women
would then be given to the men of the tribe of Benjamin (Judges 21:12-13).
After the virgin women of the minor tribe were redistributed to the Benjamites,
it was discovered that there were still not enough women to keep the Benjamites
viable as a tribe (Judges 21:14). The leaders then decided that it would be
best for the Benjamites to go to a festival and simply kidnap the daughters
that came out to dance. If the fathers of the kidnapped daughters came to
complain, the leaders planned to tell them, &quot;it's better that they were
kidnapped than that they were the spoils of the war which we could have
declared on you.&quot; (Judges 21:19-22). The Benjamites did what the leaders
told them to do, kidnapping an unknown number of virgin girls and God was
pleased (Judges 21:23-24).</P>
<P>When a woman was &quot;purchased&quot; by a marriage contract, the mother
and father of this woman were required to keep the wedding night sheets (which
would be blood stained to prove her virginity) just in case the man ever
decided that he wanted to challenge her virginity. If the man had falsely
accused her of not being a virgin, then he had to pay a fine to the father of
his wife. But if her parents couldn't produce the bloody artifacts, the woman
would be taken to her father's house and stoned to death by the men of the city
(Deuteronomy 22:13-21). The manner of execution for the daughter of a priest
who was found to be lacking in her virginity was by fire (Leviticus 21:9).
Later, if a man found some &quot;uncleanness&quot; in his wife he could declare
that she was damaged or soiled goods, and he could easily get rid of her by
writing a bill of divorce (Deuteronomy 24:1-4). </P>
<P>The Bible encourages men to fondle their women, particularly their breasts
(Proverbs 5:18-19), but if a woman were to accidentally grab a man's genitals
while that man was fighting with her husband, she was to have her hand cut off
(Deuteronomy 25:11-12)</P>
<P>If a man made an oath, his word was considered his bond, but if a woman made
an oath it had to be cleared through her father or husband first before it was
considered binding (Numbers 30:2-16)</P>
<P>The Bible tells us that Jesus also mistreated women, including his own
mother. When his mother was worried about his safety, Jesus got upset at her,
arrogantly asking &quot;Why were you looking for me?&quot; (Luke 2:49) and when
she tried to tell him that they were out of wine at a wedding feast, the
drunkard Jesus replied, &quot;Woman, what have I to do with you?&quot; (John
2:3-4). He further displayed his respect of motherhood by ignoring a desperate
mother who came to him broken-hearted over her dying daughter (Mattew
15:22-26). Jesus also taught that men should abandon their wives and children
if they wanted to receive eternal life (Matthew 19:29, Mark 10:29-30, Luke
18:29-30).</P>
<P>A woman's purpose in life to the patriarchal system of the ancient Hebrews
was to be a recepticle for man's seed. If a woman were unable to produce male
children then she was considered cursed. Without a husband or sons to take care
of her, women were forced to live in exile, digging through the trash for
scraps to survive. The widow was considered an outscast that had envoked the
wrath of God in some manner so the people scorned her. The story of Ruth in the
Bible shows us the horrid treatment which these &quot;deserted&quot; women
could expect from God's people.</P>
<P>Ruth was the daughter-in-law of a widow named Naomi. Naomi had two sons but
both of these sons died, leaving Naomi without any male support in her old age.
Naomi told Ruth and the wife of her other dead son to return to their own
people, where they could remarry and hopefully have children that would take
care of them in their old age, since she knew that she was too old to remarry
or to have sons that would take care of her, she was &quot;without hope&quot;
(Ruth 1:12). One of the daughter-in-laws left to return to her own people but
Ruth decided to stay with Naomi. When Naomi returned to her home town she told
people not to call her Naomi (which meant &quot;pleasant) but instead, to call
her Mara (which meant &quot;bitter&quot; because she was bitter with how the
Lord had treated her by taking her sons who were supposed to support her in her
old age). </P>
<P>Ruth went out to gather scraps from what the harvesters left behind in the
fields and she met up with a rich man who treated her kindly (Ruth 2:1-23). God
had made a law which said that if a woman's husband died before he could
provide her with a son, then the brother of that man was required to take the
widow of his brother and have sex with her until she had a son (Deuteronomy
25:5-6). Naomi knew of this law and when Ruth told her about the rich man, she
saw it as an opportunity to get Ruth hitched to him. The only problem was, this
man wasn't legally next in line to take Ruth and make her pregnant according to
the law. Naomi told Ruth that she had to go to the rich man's tent at night and
snuggle up next to him, telling him of her plight and convince him that he
should be the one to take her and make her pregnant. Ruth did this, uncovering
his genitals and lying down next to them (Ruth 3:4-8). The older man was
shocked to see a young woman interested in him sexually and he was more than
willing to take Ruth into his household. The rich man convinces the man who is
legally next in line to take Ruth, that it is in his best financial interest to
let him take her (Ruth 4:1-12). So the rich man takes Ruth and makes her
pregnant with a son (who became the grandfather of King David). Naomi was now
happy because she had a grandson which meant that she was somebody once more in
the Hebrew society (Ruth 4:13-17).</P>
<P>We at the Luciferian Liberation Front are grateful for the countless women
who have had the personal integrity to raise their heads out of the shackles of
subservience that the &quot;men of God&quot; have forged for them. Women such
as Ayn Rand, stand as true heroines to humanity and we praise them for using
their brilliant minds to show the world how things should be. Praise Connie.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><U><A NAME="testicle">Swearing an
Oath</A></U></FONT></I></H4>
<P>Whenever an Israelite swore an oath he would seal it by placing his hand on
the genitals of the person he was swearing to. The Bible calls this
&quot;putting a hand under his thigh&quot; and it is from this tradition of
grabbing a person's testicles that we get the words &quot;testify,&quot; and
&quot;testimony.&quot; When Abraham sent a servant out to look for a wife for
his son, he made this servant swear that he wouldn't bring back a Canaanite
woman for his son to marry. The oath was sealed by the servant grabbing
Abraham's genitals Genesis 24:1-9). This signified that the oath extended not
only to the person who was being grabbed, but also extended to that persons
unborn children or &quot;seed&quot; which was stored in the testicles. In this
way, the oath didn't expire just because the person died, because as long as
the person's seed continued to live, the oath stayed in effect.</P>
<P>When Jacob was about to die, he made his son swear upon his genitals that he
wouldn't bury him in Egypt but would carry his body back to his homeland to be
buried (Genesis 47:29-31).</P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="bestiality"><U>Beauty and
the Beast</U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>The Hebrew law specifically forbade both men AND women from having sexual
relations with animals (Deuteronomy 27:21, Levitcus 18:23). The punishment for
participating in this beastly activity was death (Exodus 22:19). This death
penalty not only extended to the person, but the animal that had participated
(Leviticus 20:15-16). This is just another example of the injustice of God's
laws. It didn't matter that the animal hadn't sinned, or that it doesn't have
the ability to know right from wrong not to mention that sex between a human
and animal can only be called rape since the animal wouldn't naturally attempt
to cohabit with a human. Unfortunately, the numerous abuses of animals in the
Bible is vastly overshadowed by the abuses of humans.</P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="toilet"><U>Jehovah's
Potty</U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>One of the more unusual types of plagues which God unleashed on humanity was
the plague of hemorrhoids. The biblical term for hemorrhoid is
&quot;emerod&quot; and God threatened to give them to his own people in
Deuteronomy 28:27. God also sent the plague of hemorrhoids to his enemy, the
Philistines (1 Samuel 5:6-12) because they had stolen the ark of the covenant.
After seven months of torment, the Philistines were willing to do just about
anything to get rid the hemorrhoids and the plagues of mice which God had
cursed their land with. God told the Philistine priests and diviners that they
had to return the ark but that it wasn't to come back alone. They were to send
a trespass offering of five golden replicas of their hemorrhoids and five
golden statues of mice with it (1 Samuel 6:1-18). The Philistines did this and
gave the ark got back to the Israelites, who peeked inside to see if the
Philistines had stolen the holy items that were supposed to be inside the ark
God had warned them not to look inside the ark and as a result of their
curiosity, God killed 50,070 of God's chosen men, the Israelites (1 Samuel
6:19-21).</P>
<P>God's anal fixation in the Bible extended to the human products of
excretion. God threatened to spread feces on the faces of his disobedient
priests (Malachi 2:1-3). God also commanded Ezekiel to bake his bread with
human feces. Ezekiel protested that he had never put anything unclean into his
mouth and God relented by saying that he could bake his bread with cow feces
instead (Ezekiel 4:10-17). Gee, thanks God.</P>
<P>The Bible tells us that during a famine in Samaria, the people were so
desperate for food that they bought and sold the feces of doves for the
equivalent of three dollars a pint (2 Kings 6:25)</P>
<P>The Bible also paints a pretty picture in its literary imagery of men
urinating on walls (1 Samuel 25:22, 35:34, 1 Kings 14:10, 16:11, 21:21, 2 Kings
9:8). As if that weren't enough, the filthy Bible describes men eating their
own feces and drinking their own urine (2 Kings 18:27, Isaiah 36:12). </P>
<P>God even claims that his farts will sound like a harp for the Moabites
(Isaiah 16:11). What's that ungodly stench?</P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="solomon"><U>Solomon's
Steamy Song of Sleaze </U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>The Song of Solomon, or &quot;Song of Songs&quot; as it is sometimes called,
has somehow made it through the biblical editing and censoring process to
remain as sensual and erotic as the feelings which Solomon must have shared for
the Shunammite woman, Abishag. The Song was a love poem which celebrated the
passions and ecstasies of carnal, physical love. Modern Christians try to
downplay the obvious references to sex but it doesn't take much imagination to
see exactly what Solomon was talking about.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>Chapter 1</U></P>
<P>The first chapter has the black skinned, Shulamith anticipating spending the
night in Solomon's bedchamber. She hopes he will kiss her with his mouth
because his love is better than wine (ver. 2). She then expresses her desire
that Solomon will lie all night between her breasts (ver. 13).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>Chapter 2</U></P>
<P>Shulamith continues to describe her lust for Solomon. She compares him to an
apple tree that she sat down under &quot;and his fruit was sweet to my
taste,&quot; an obvious reference to oral sex (ver. 3). She then describes
Solomon fondling her in the same manner that the Sumuzi-Inanna love poems from
2,000 B.C.E. used: &quot;Your right hand you have placed on my vulva; Your left
stroked my head.&quot; (ver. 6)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>Chapter 3</U></P>
<P>Shulamith, wakes up and finds that Solomon is not in bed with her so she
goes out into the city to find him (ver. 1-2). Once she does, she takes him to
his mother's house, then when whe is done having sex with her, she asks that
his other wives not wake him until he is ready to get up himself (ver. 5).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>Chapter 4</U></P>
<P>Now Solomon describes his lover starting from the top of her head and
working down. He uses sensual allegories such as calling her breasts &quot;two
fawns which feed among the lilies&quot; (ver. 5). Next he tells how her lips
drip honey and how tasty her tongue is (ver. 11). He then describes her mons
pubis as &quot;the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense&quot; (myrrh
and frankincense were spices with a musky odor - ver. 6) and he goes on to
describe her vaginal moistness as &quot;streams flowing from her home town of
Lebanon&quot; (ver. 15). Repeatedly the references to oral sex are made by
disguising the female sex organs as a &quot;garden and its fruits&quot; (ver.
12-14). Shulamith then calls on the wind to make the scent of her womanhood
waft out. She then asks her lover to eat of her garden's fruit once more (ver.
16).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>Chapter 5</U></P>
<P>Solomon repeatedly refers to his lover as his &quot;sister&quot; while he
states that he has now had his way with her, eating and drinking his fill of
her fruits (ver. 1). Shulamith then takes over the narrative and in metaphor
states the following: &quot;I woke up because my love has let me know that he
wants to have sex with me again. (ver. 2) But I am not aroused right now, since
I just woke up (ver. 3)&quot; She then states that her love &quot;put his hand
by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.&quot; (ver. 5).
Apparently by stimulating her anal region, he has aroused her because she
states that she is now up and her hands are dripping with her musky vaginal
juices, but her lover has withdrawn himself and has gone (ver. 5-6). This may
be an example of biblical premature ejaculation or perhaps Solomon was only
interested in achieving his own pleasure during this instance, because when
Shulamith tries to reach him, he has already left.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>Chapter 6</U></P>
<P>Solomon continues to sensually praise his lovers body. He states that at
this point in his life, he has sixty wives (queens), eighty sex slaves
(concubines) and countless maidens which he can have sex with but he claims
that Shulamith is still unique and even all his other sex partners have praised
her (ver. 8-10).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>Chapter 7</U></P>
<P>Solomon continues with the sensual praising of Shulamith, this time starting
at the feet and working his way up. Shulamith takes over the narrative and she
asks her lover to take her outdoors where she will let him have sex with her in
the vineyard. She also mentions the aphrodisiac mandrake plant and promises him
that she has all types of fruits for him to partake of (ver. 11-13). </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>Chapter 8</U></P>
<P>The final chapter has Shulamith telling Solomon that she wishes he had been
her brother &quot;that sucked the breasts of my mother&quot; so that when she
found him outside, she could kiss him and that her mother would teach her how
to please him sexually. She then makes reference to the early quoted passage
from the Sumuzi-Inanna love poems about &quot;Your right hand you have placed
on my vulva; Your left stroked my head&quot; (ver. 3). Once again we see the
spectre of incest rearing its head in the Bible. Shulamith recalls that when
she was a little girl &quot;with no breasts&quot; her brothers attempted to
protect her from the sexual advances of men. If she was a &quot;wall,&quot; (if
she resisted the men) they would protect her in one way and if she were a
&quot;door,&quot; (if she gave in easily to the men) they would protect her
another way. Shulamith claims that she is a wall and her &quot;breasts are like
towers&quot; (ver. 8-11), and it was because she was hard to get that Solomon
found her attractive (ver. 10).</P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="nefilim"><U>The Sons of
God Need Lovin' Too</U></A></FONT></I></H4>
<P>Humans weren't the only ones having sex in the Bible. God's sons came down
and lusted after human women and took them for their own wives (Genesis 6:1-2).
These were the same sons of God that presented themselves before God in Job
1:6, 2:1. Modern Christians try to say that these sons of God were demons or
fallen angels or they just ignore this passage in the Bible completely. Why the
all-powerful God would allow for his sons to mate with humans raises some
intrituing questions about sex in heaven. The Bible tells us that angels aren't
married in heaven but Jesus repeatedly compares himself to the bridegroom and
his followers to the bride (Matthew 9:15, John 3:29). We hate to remind
Christians about what happens on the honeymoon, especially in light of the fact
that God's sons were having sex with human women. BOHICA. Thank you Jesus.</P>
