<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Welcome to the ranks of the Luciferian Liberation Front! Your application for ordination has been sent to the bowels of hell where it will be personally reviewed by Satan and his minions (isn't the internet incredible?). You have taken a bold step into a brighter future for all mankind. You can access the Members Only Section of our website at <a href="llfwarrior.html" target="">http://www.luciferianliberationfront.org/llfwarrior.html</a>



We will be adding a forum for members to share their personal experiences from their quests to enlighten the ignorant masses very soon.
Your name will be added to the roles which will also be posted in the Members Only Section. 

Good luck, keep your head down and TAKE NO PRISONERS!</FONT></P>
