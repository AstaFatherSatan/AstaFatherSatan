manipulators of mankind</I></H3>
<H4><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">Aliens.  Some appear to be cute and almost cuddly
while others strike sheer terror in the hearts of men.  The major players in the
battle for the future of the human race and their hidden agendas and tactics are
finally exposed.  </FONT></H4>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>The world is slowly being conditioned to accept
the presence of alien beings in our reality.  Fifty years ago, people committed
suicide rather than face the possibility that the Earth had been visited by
aliens from outer space.  The radio broadcast of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;
revealed the hysteria which the general populace would experience if faced with
that scenario.  For that reason, the powers that be have adopted a policy of
slow desensitization to the alien presence and over a fifty year time span have
made the face of the alien gray a fashion accessory.</B></FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Exactly who are these alien entities and what is their purpose in
visiting our planet?  Where do they come from?  How did they get here?  Above
all else, are they angels or benevolent space brothers, here to assist us in our
ascension or are they demons or cosmic cattle ranchers, herding us to the
slaughter?  </B></P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Before we analyze the specific alien groups, remember that the
generalizations we present do not necessarily apply to each individual member of
an alien species, unless that species shares a collective consciousness (which
the majority of the ones we will discuss do).  It would be irrational to
stereotype the motives of an entire race of individuals just as it is irrational
to pre-judge all humans as being &quot;sinful,&quot; or to suggest that all
members of a race or skin color are lazy or evil.  In the absence of a
collective consciousness it is best to apply the admonition &quot;by their
fruits you will know them&quot; when judging the actions of the individual
being.  
</B></P>
<P><B>In order to judge actions we must first establish a standard of
measurement to determine relative &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil.&quot;  As
Luciferians and human beings, the standard we raise is that of &quot;life,
liberty and happiness of the individual.&quot;  Placing the value of self above
the value of the collective or the group.  In this manner we can know if the
actions of an entity are good (contribute to the happiness and liberty of the
individual) or evil (disregard the individual, enslaving him to the demands of
the whole or the will of &quot;The One&quot; i.e., God).  This standard is more
fully explained in <A HREF="objectiv.html">A Brief Overview of Objectivism and
Freethought</A></B></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">A.K.A. The Anunnaki, The Vedas, The Anakim, The
Nefilim, Jehovah, The Sons of God</FONT></H3>
<P><B>This alien race made its first appearance on Earth millions of years
ago.  Coming from a planet in our own solar system which orbits the sun once
every few thousand years (also called &quot;the 12th planet&quot;), they have
genetically altered their DNA to stop the aging process and appear to be &quot;immortal.&quot;</B></P>
<P><B>They mixed their DNA with primitive man in order to create a slave race
to assist them with their mining efforts on this planet.  Some of the members of
this race attempted to aid the humans, giving them the ability to reproduce and
attempting to  remove the aging process from their DNA.  These helpers of
mankind rebeled against the plans of the leaders of the Elohim who wanted to
keep man subservient.  In doing this, they, along with any who attempt to free
mankind from the enslavement of the manipulators of mankind, were labeled &quot;EVIL.&quot;
One of the few alien species we can trust to assist us in our battle for liberty
are these rebel &quot;Sons of God&quot; (Genesis 6:4) or <A HREF="#Nordics">Nordics</A>
who  have broken from the reigns of the collective and illuminated the path of
rational self interest for man.  </B></P>
<P><B>The original Elohim used genetic and social engineering to attempt to
keep man subservient.  After realizing that man could become a threat to the
agenda of the Elohim at the tower of Babel, individual members of the Elohim
built congregations and cities of followers (slaves).  The recruitment of
Abraham in the Bible by &quot;the Lord&quot; (Genesis 12:1-3, 17:7-8) was an
example of how the Elohim chose humans and agreed to &quot;be their God.&quot; 
Numerous other religious systems of belief were established by the Elohim in
order to keep man divided against himself and thus unable to work together for
their own betterment.  For example, the &quot;angel&quot; Gabriel established
the Jewish religion and then turned around and established the rival religion of
Islam.  The gods of the Hindus, Greeks, Summerians, American Indians and others
were also established by the Elohim.</B></P>
<P><B>The Elohim are members of the Galactic Confederation, a group of
similarly oriented alien races, whose mission it is to align all planetary races
with the will of the collective or &quot;The One.&quot;  Their ultimate agenda
is altruistic obedience to the rule of The One.  The Bible speaks of a time when
the entire world will be subject to the will of The One (&quot;every knee shall
bow to me&quot; - Romans 14:11, Isaiah 45:23).  Strict obedience without
question is the hallmark of &quot;righteousness&quot; according to the writings
of the Elohim.  As we show throughout our web site, the will of the Elohim does
not support the good of the human race and must be aggressively resisted if we
are to survive.</B></P>

Reptilians</H1>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">Originating from various locations to include a
region of space called Alpha Draconis, these include reptiles which reside
outside our vibrational frequency (the 4th dimension) as well as evolved Earth
reptiles which escaped the cataclysm which destroyed the dinosaurs.</FONT></H3>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR="#80FF80">Extraterrestrial Reptilians</FONT></H3>
<P><B>The Draconians are an extraterrestrial race of reptile which come from
the Alpha Draconis star system.  In general the draconians are intergalactic
invaders, seeking out and infiltrating into the societies of other life forms. 
They prefer to manipulate society from behind the scenes and will openly invade
and conquer only when they become threatened by the technological advancement of
their prey.  It is highly likely that some of the Draconians work alongside of
the <A HREF="#IDs">Interdimensional Reptilians</A> as allies.  Both types of
alien entities are able to utilize the psychic energies emitted from the brains
of humans during intensely emotional experiences.  The reptilians of both this
dimension and the 4th dimension feed off of fear and panic from humans.  They
also possess the ability to confuse humans by projecting a mental image, making
themselves appear human (as Men In Black) or clouding the memory of any who
encounter them. </B></P>
<P><IMG
SRC="reptilian.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="277"><B>When
the Draconians predict that the civilization they have infiltrated is
approaching the state of evolution where their technological ability makes the
reptiles' covert operations subject to compromise, they launch an overt invasion
fleet in the form of a Planetoid/Asteroids base station or mother ship. (Note:
Some people theorize that the reptilian mother ship locates and follows closely
behind comets heading in the same general direction, using the gravitational
field to pull the planetoid along through space. The comet's body also acts as a
stellar debris impact shield and prevents any approaching civilization from
observing their mother ship's advance. The Heaven's Gate cult misinterpreted
channeled alien propoganda and believed that the comet Hale Bopp was this
invasion fleet.  For more details see
<A HREF="Borg.html">Jesus of Borg</A>)  
</B></P>
<P><IMG
SRC="repgrey.gif" ALT="Reptilian/Grey Hybrid" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="274"><B>In
between invasions, the majority of the reptilian population on the mother ship
live in a state of hibernation. A contingency of reptilians manage the daily
operations of the craft and maintain hibernation chambers while awaiting the
invasion order. The reptilians on the planet's surface ensure the continued
secrecy of their presence, carry out abductions of various life forms on the
surface of the planet, and monitor the technological advances of the surface
inhabitants.  They also introduce their reptilian genetic code into whatever
species displays traits they want to manipulate, and initiates a program of
genetic crossbreeding.  Some of the species of <A HREF="#greys">Greys</A>and
humanoid <A HREF="#Nordics">Nordics</A> have been invaded and assimilated in
this manner. </B></P>
<P><B>From their underground bases, they set the stage for the mother's ship
invasion by establishing a network of human-reptilian crossbred infiltrates
within various levels of the surface culture's military industrial complexes,
government bodies, religions, UFO/paranormal groups, and fraternal (priest)
orders, etc. These crossbreeds, some unaware of their reptilian genetic &quot;mind-control&quot;
instructions, act out their subversive roles as &quot;reptilian agents&quot;,
setting the stage for an reptilian led alien invasion.   Just prior to planetary
approach, the large reptilian population aboard the planetoid awakens from their
hibernation and prepares for battle. When the invasion takes place, it is from
above and below the planets surface. Strange craft, piloted by reptilians, greys
and human-reptilian agents, descend from the clouds while others ascend to the
skies from the underworld of caverns and sub-cities, overwhelming the surface
cultures in a totally unsuspecting manner.  </B></P>
<P><IMG
SRC="reptoid.jpeg" ALT="Extraterrestrial Reptilian" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="203"><B>The
reptilian species, like other races which share a collective consciousness,
communicate telepathically.  Their advanced telepathic ability allows them to be
able to utilitze energies emitted by the brains of other species. 
</B></P>
<P><IMG
SRC="winged.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="299"><B>At
least one of the Draconian races possess leathery wings which have been mistaken
for hoods or cloaks by abductees.  This race stands around 8 feet tall, dwells
underground and comes out at night.  They have been labeled &quot;mothmen,&quot;
and is the source for mythologies concerning angels, demons, vampires,
gargoyles, valkyries and other winged beings.  </B></P>
<P><B>Different extraterrestrial reptilian species have different agendas but
the majority of them focus on domination and exploitation of alien races and
their planetary resources.  Their viscious hostility and blatant disregard for
the individual rights of others makes them a mortal enemy to mankind.</B></P>
<H3><IMG
SRC="dimensio.gif" ALT="Interdimensional reptilians entering an abductee's bedroom" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="209"><FONT
COLOR="#80FF80"><A NAME="IDs">Interdimensional Reptilians</A></FONT></H3>
<P><B>Interdimensional reptilians reside outside of our physical plane or
dimension.  They are composed of matter which vibrates at a frequency which is
out of synch with the world our senses can perceive.  It is theorized that this
altered vibrational frequency (sometimes called &quot;sub-space&quot;) is an
astral plane where energy demons dwell or is where the energy from our soul
matrix goes after our physical bodies die.  In the absence of further evidence
we will merely report these theories and not speculate on their validity.
</B></P>
<P><B>The interdimensional reptilians are able to alter the vibrational
frequency which seperates our dimension and theirs (also called the 4th
dimension) in areas where nuclear testing has taken place due to alterations in
the fabric of time-space.  Some groups of interdimensional reptilians are able
to freely enter and leave our dimension through portals that they create.  Some
of these portals have been torn by the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) which
accompany nuclear weapons testing.  The appearance of interdimensional
reptilians and their vehicles around nuclear test sites supports this premise. 
It is also possible that extraterrestrial reptilians are using the 4th
dimensional vibrational flux as a means of transportation.  Other groups of
interdimensional beings are unable to enter our world as easily and must rely on
3rd dimensional agents to affect change in this dimension.</B></P>
<P><B>The greatest threat from the interdimensional beings centers on their
need for the energies provided from emotional responses and their ability to
manipulate the suggestive human consciousness.  Through tools such as religion,
nationalism, racism, and other emotionally charged conditions, they are able to
provoke humans through stress, anger, guilt, and most of all FEAR, to engage in
warfare against their fellow man, creating a vicious cycle of even more intense
human emotions through the tragic results of these conflicts.  The increasing
number of senseless shootings at schools, day care centers and postal facilities
is a direct result of the hunger of the reptilians.  The emotional responses to
reptilian orchestrated religious worship, global conflict, genocide, drug usage,
sexual perversions and violence in general all provide these &quot;psychic
vampires&quot; or &quot;energy leeches&quot; with a veritable cornicopia of
energy to feast on.  It's time we closed the buffet line.</B></P>

<P><B>65 million years ago the Earth was struck by an asteroid which brought
about the extinction of the majority of the world's living dinosaurs.  There
were, however, some species which escaped extinction by dwelling underground in
caverns and labyrinths beneath the earth's surface.  The image on the left is
what modern science theorized one of these evolved reptiles might look like
today.  This creature is strikingly similar to ones which have been identified
as living in underground bases in New Mexico and across the world.  </B></P>
<P><B>The velociraptor received global attention with the success of the &quot;Jurrasic
Park&quot; movies.  This dinosaur was able to communicate via ultrasonic means
and may have possessed a form of &quot;telepathic&quot; capability.  If the
cunning velociraptor has been evolving underground for the last 65 million
years, it is only reasonable that man's legends would contain references to
dragonmen or serpentmen.  The role and agenda of the terran reptilians in the
cosmic conspiracy is currently the subject of much debate.</B></P>

<A NAME="greys">The Greys</A></H1>
<H3><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The most commonly encountered alien species is
known as the &quot;Greys&quot; due to the greyish color of their skin.  There
are several species of Greys which have interacted with mankind in one form or
other during our history.  The Greys share several common characteristic traits
to include a telepathic genetic/technological collective consciousness and the
inability to feel emotion. </FONT></B></H3>
<H2><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">Zeta Reticuli Greys</FONT></B></H2><IMG
SRC="zeta.gif" ALT="Zeta Reticuli Grey" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="101" HEIGHT="200">
<P><B>The Zeta Reticuli Greys originate from Zeta Reticulan, a star system 
which  is near the constellation Orion.  The average between 3 and 4 feet in
height.  Whereas humans have evolved from primates, the Greys have evolved from
a cetacean or dolphin like life form.  Just as humanity was genetically altered
by the Elohim to be used as slaves, the Greys were genetically altered and
advanced for the purposes of their &quot;Gods&quot; who we will call &quot;The
Masters.&quot;  The Greys were not as fortunate as humanity however, because
there was no rebel activity to liberate them from the grasp of the collective
will of the Masters as there was with us.  </B></P>
<P><B>The Masters mixed their DNA with that of the evolving cetaceans from
Zeta Reticulan and created mules which were unable to reproduce (just like Adam
and Eve in the Garden of Eden).  They also genetically altered the digestive
systems of the Greys to make them more efficient as slaves.  The Greys no longer
have a functional reproductive or digestive tract because of the genetic
manipulations of the Masters.  They now absorb nutrients and secrete wastes
through their skin.  This genetic variance is of great value to the Masters
since much less space is required for food storage and waste processing which
makes them ideal for use as slaves who are engineered to work in the limited
area of a spacecraft. 
<IMG
SRC="cattlemu.gif" ALT="Mutilated Cow" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="319" HEIGHT="220">The
nutrients the Greys require are found in high concentrations in mucous membranes
which is why they have been mutilating cattle (and humans to a lesser known
degree).  To &quot;eat&quot; they soak in vats of nutrients which are full of
the secretions from human and animal body parts.</B></P>
<P><B>To reproduce, the Greys must be cloned.  Because DNA begins to breakdown
after being repeatedly cloned, in order for the Greys to keep their species from
dying, they must integrate new strands of DNA into their own.  Until they are
able to create a hybrid Grey life form which possesses the ability to reproduce,
they will continue to require outside sources of DNA to maintain their species. 
The Greys have been abducting humans and performing experiments on their
reproductive systems in order to create a strain of Grey with reproductive
capability.
</B></P><IMG
SRC="alienexam.jpeg" ALT="Greys examining an abductee" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="283" HEIGHT="366">
<P><B>From the time of their enslavement, the Greys have been at the mercy of
more technologically advanced species.  One of these species is the Draconian
reptile race.  The reptilians conquered the Zeta Reticli Greys centuries ago and
forced them into slavery.  The reptilians created a robotic race of Grey clones
by taking advantage of the telepathic capability of the Greys.  By implanting
telepathic amplifyers into the brains of the Greys they were able to tie the
minds of the Greys into an artificial central computer.  This created an
artificially controllable &quot;collective consciousness&quot; whereby the Greys
can be monitored and controlled by their Masters.  The mother brain for the
Greys which are in our solar system was what the Russian Phobos probe uncovered
in 1989, leading to the destruction of that probe by the Grey defense system.</B></P>
<P><IMG
SRC="master.jpeg" ALT='A Grey ascended "master"' ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="218" HEIGHT="206"><B>The
Zeta Reticuli Greys have been in communication telepathically with human
channelers, feeding them conflicting propoganda to mislead trusting humans into
accepting them as our &quot;saviors.&quot;  They are the agents of their
Masters, deceiving humanity through religious &quot;visions,&quot; (such as at
Fatima) prophecies and miracles in an attempt to gain our trust.  Once the
reptilian mother ship arrives from Zeta Reticulan, these same Greys will appear
as ANGELS, inviting those who desire to escape the destruction of the earth into
the clouds where they will meet with their &quot;master;&quot; JESUS.  Promising
a NEW AGE of peace and harmony with all of mankind attached to the ONE just as
they are, their true goal is the annihilation of human individuality and its
unpredictability.  Since they do not possess emotions, they see human
unpredictability as their greatest threat.  The assimilation of individuality
into the collective of THE ONE must be resisted if our race is to remain free.</B></P>

<P><B>These small aliens have been the subject of tales of fairies, gnomes,
elves, pixies, and other &quot;little people.&quot;  They come from the same
genetic roots as the Zeta Reticuli, but little more is known about their race. 
They possess the technological ability to alter the fabric of space, giving them
the ability to pass through solid matter and alter the relative size of objects.
 They are usually between 6 and 18 inches in height.</B></P>

<P><B>This race of Greys stands between 7 and 8 feet tall (similar to the
Nephilim)  and they tend to have a more developed nose than other Grey species. 
When they are observed they appear to be in charge of groups of shorter robotic
Greys.  Some abductees have detected emotional responses (sympathy, loathing,
disgust, etc.) coming from these tall beings.  The Orion Greys have also been
seen working alongside various reptilian species.  As in all situations, the
actions of individual members of a species cannot be taken to reflect the intent
of all members of that species.  The evidence suggests that some members of the
Orion Greys may be sympathetic to the plight of humanity and may offer
technological assistance in the upcoming alien confrontation.</B></P>
<H1><A NAME="Nordics">The Nordics</A></H1><IMG

<P><B>There are several human-like species which interact with humanity. 
These include the <A HREF="#Elohim">Elohim</A>, Pleiadians, Venusians, Vegans,
Lyrans, Arcturians, Orions, Sirians, and others.  Our race shares a common
genetic ancestry with many of these species.  </B></P>
<P><B>There have been numerous mental or &quot;spiritual&quot; contacts
between these supposed friends of man.  Some claim to be members of a galactic
federation, whose purpose is to protect all life and aid in our ascension to the
next age.  If they are truly the galactic policemen they claim to be, then by
their fruits we will know them.  If they are merely another ploy by an invasion
force, we will also be aware of, and prepared for, that possibility.  Our
ancestors tell of a race of human nordics (the ancestors of the Scandinavians)
who escaped the wrath of the Elohim at the time of the Flood by leaving the
planet with a group of Nefilim.  These Nordics may be our greatest allies in the
approaching reptilian invasion.  Time will only tell.</B></P>
<HR>
<P><B>When analyzing the motives of these alien races, we must remember to
judge their activities based on whether they are supportive of our individual
rights and our quest for life, liberty, and happiness, or whether they desire to
enlist us in their quest for oneness.  We cannot allow the glitter of membership
in the Intergalactic Federation to distract us from our own best interest. 
Objectivism must be our standard.  Altruism and sacrifice must not replace
rational self-interest.  Repeatedly, the lure of ONENESS is used by tyrants to
stifle the questions of the rational few.  It is for this same reason that the
Bible commands us not to question God.  The common theme of the &quot;spiritually
concerned&quot; aliens is this loss of individuality and reasoning (&quot;Lean
not on your own understanding.&quot; - Proverbs 3:5). Anytime we are approached
by anyone who wants us to join their collective, we must remember the ultimate
goal of this collective is to create a void of sameness where the only will
which exists is that of the collective ONE, and the elite few in charge are the
dictators of that will.  Question Authority.  Resistance is NOT futile.</B></P>
