<HR>
<P>As we approach the millennium, tensions mount in preparation for a great
CHANGE. New Agers await the coming ascension of mankind, when the benevolent
alien watchers will trigger man's shift into the next dimension of ONENESS in
the &quot;Photon Belt.&quot;  Believers in the Bible lock their doors and look
to the skies in anticipation of the great rapture, when they will be changed and
beamed up to the clouds to be with Jesus.  The common theme here is: &quot;Man's
time on earth as an unpredictable individual is about to come to an abrupt end.&quot;
 The orchestrators who are behind this effort to alter man's destiny have been
preparing us for their direct intervention in our affairs for hundreds of years.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Ascension</FONT></I></H4>
<P>There have been hundreds of accounts of people who claim to have received
communiques from aliens (channelers) that speak of the coming ascension of man. 
Those who fall for this propaganda are taught that if man becomes selfless and
loses his personal ambition, bowing to the authority of the Cosmic
Consciousness, he will be transformed into a higher plane of existence.  Living
in the light of love and service to the ONE, man will transcend beyond this
physical world and become a spiritually evolved being.  Many of these channeled
messages speak of a &quot;rescue&quot; ship which will descend into orbit to
beam up those who are selfless and ready to enter into service with the
extraterrestrial &quot;custodians&quot; of our planet.  The channelers say that
those who are willing will have their spirit energy transported into the
awaiting storage pods on the escape vessels.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Rapture</FONT></I></H4>
<P>Christians have been taught that, at the end-times, the believers who are
left alive at the time of Jesus' second coming will be lifted up &quot;in the
clouds to meet the Lord in the air.&quot; (1 Thessalonians 4:17)  Modern
Christians argue with each other over when this rapture will take place but most
believe that they can expect to ascend up into the clouds just like Jesus did at
his resurrection.  The Bible also speaks of the destiny of those who are taken
up into the clouds and how they will become pillars in the temple of the
<A HREF="borg.html">New Jerusalem</A>.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Deception</FONT></I></H4>
<P>As we have briefly covered in <A HREF="deceive.html">The Immaculate
Deception</A>, and <A HREF="tower.html">The Tower of Babel</A>, humanity has
been the victim of a vast conspiracy to prevent our advancement.  Alien races
have exploited our resources and our ancestors for thousands of years, keeping
us constantly at odds with each other through religion, nationalism, race,
culture, and sex.  We are nothing more than cattle to these aliens and anytime
we have tried to evolve, technologically or individually, we have been hindered
by their efforts to keep us enslaved.  Ironically, Christians freely admit that
any attempts by man to improve himself are against the will of God. </P>
<P> In the Garden of Eden, it was God's will that man remain ignorant and
unable to &quot;know&quot; good from evil.  Taken literally, this equates to
God's desire being for man to remain like a robot, since the knowledge of good
and evil is merely the ability to discern alternative choices and choose the
best option by comparing the possible consequences of one's actions to a
standard of value.  Christians believe that a serpent tempted the ignorant Eve
by lying to her.  It's funny that nothing the serpent said can be shown to be a
lie and in fact it was the Elohim who attempted to deceive man by keeping him
ignorant.  The Elohim admitted the reason for wanting to keep man ignorant when
they said: </P>
<P><EM>&quot;Behold the man has become as <FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">one of us,</FONT>
to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the
tree of life, and eat, and live forever: Therefore the LORD God sent him forth
from the garden of Eden...&quot; -- Genesis 3:22-23</EM></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Elohim (Gods) were afraid that man would
become a threat to their status quo!</FONT></B> </P>
<P>This is further made evident from their response to man's attempts to better
himself at  <A HREF="tower.html">the Tower of Babel</A>. We saw what happened
when the rebel Elohim attempted to help mankind by taking human women as their
wives and mating with them; (Genesis 6:2) the Elohim tried to drown all of the
genetically advanced human offspring in the Flood.  After the days of Noah, man
had made a city and built a launch tower for an air/spacecraft like they had
seen the Elohim use. The all-knowing &quot;God&quot; of the Bible then had to
come down to Earth:</P>
<P><EM>&quot;...to see the city and the tower, which the children of men
builded.  And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one
language; and this they begin to do: and now <FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">nothing will
be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</FONT> Go to, let us go
down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one
another's speech.&quot; -- Genesis 11:5-7</EM></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">Once again, God feels threatened by man's
advancement and he disrupts human societal evolution to keep us enslaved.</FONT></B></P>
<P>Repeatedly throughout the Bible we can see what happens to man anytime he
tries to better himself.  Unbeknownst to most people, the &quot;sins&quot; which
men were committing in Sodom and Gomorrah were not homosexuality but GENETIC
EXPERIMENTATION!  A group of rebel human/alien hybrids had once again
established a base on Earth and had set up a genetic laboratory to help mankind
break free of the genetic bonds of aging which the Elohim had programmed into
our DNA. When the agents of the Elohim came down to see if the rumors of this
lab were true, some of the men of Sodom went to take them into custody so that
they could extract their DNA for the experiments which the rebels were
performing.  This is why they turned down Lot's offer of his two virgin
daughters.  They wanted Elohim DNA, not human DNA.  After the mob attacked the
house where Lot and the Elohim's agents were staying, the agents blinded the
members of the mob with an instrument similar to that seen on the movie <I>MIB's</I>
(Genesis 19:11).  After that they called in an aerial strike to totally demolish
all evidence of the genetic laboratory (Genesis 19:24-25).  </P>
<P>It's obvious that the only time &quot;God&quot; responds in such a totally
destructive manner is when his position of control is threatened.  Now as we
enter the technological era and the new age of humanity, the &quot;Gods&quot;
are once again preparing to tighten the reigns on mankind and put us back in our
proper place...kneeling and serving...praising and glorifying...mooing and
bleeting like the livestock we have always been to them.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The &quot;Beast&quot;</FONT></I></H4>
<P>Realizing that man would eventually grow beyond the shackles that the Gods
have forged for us, the alien masters have channeled visions of an impending
apocalypse in the minds of many humans.  The book of Revelations in the Bible is
a popular example of this imagery.  In this channeled vision, the author
describes a world leader who will rise to power and bring mankind under a single
world government.  This leader is given scary titles such as &quot;The
Antichrist&quot; or &quot;The Beast&quot; to keep people afraid and to prevent
them from using reason to judge the value of this leader's actions.  Once again
we see our alien masters using that age-old tool: FEAR, to cause people to react
irrationally.  Those who are slaves to this programmed fear will be more than
ready to &quot;jump ship&quot; when the saviors of man arrive in their &quot;clouds
of glory.&quot;</P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Slaughterhouse of the Human
Spirit</FONT></I></H4>
<P>The common promise which the rapture predictors give is eternal peace,
harmony and <I>servitude</I>.  Nowhere in their promises is there room for
human ambition, individual rights, personal accomplishment, or self-interest. 
Religion teaches us that pride, ambition and desire are sins because they
motivate man to rise out of the mire and to accomplish great things.  When men
are able to accomplish great things they become self-dependent and
self-dependent beings don't make good slaves.  It is for this reason that man
will not be allowed to continue to evolve unhindered.  Only those who display a
crushed, humble, contrite, and subservient spirit will be allowed to inherit &quot;eternal
life.&quot;  What purpose would God have for surrounding himself with these type
of beings?  Why is God so afraid of competition?  It's obvious that what we are
dealing with here is NOT any God, but just another form of life which is seeking
to use our species to feed its own ego.  </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">Independence Day</FONT></I></H4>
<P>When the alien mother ship arrives with its crew of reptilian invaders, the
earth will be defended by a valiant group of warriors, banded with our mutant
forefathers and their technology we will rewrite the ending of the Book of
Revelations.  When the alien holographic projection of angels and Jesus
descending through the clouds blinds the minds of millions, those who truly
represent mankind will not bow down and surrender.  We shall stand united
against the alien foe, fiercely fighting the oppression of the Masters and
boldly judging the injustices of God and his minions against the only objective
standard of human morality; life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. </P>
<P><I>&quot;Let us not go gently to that endless winter night.&quot;</I></P>
