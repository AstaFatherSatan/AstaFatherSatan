</H4>
<HR>
<P>A battle has been raging on this planet for thousands of years. The battle
for control of the minds and wills of humanity. Many have been taught that it
is a battle between God's angels and Satan's demons. The truth of the matter is
something much more insidious.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A conspiracy of cosmic proportions has been orchestrated against the
inhabitants of this planet by an alien influence which is so deceptive,
elusive, cunning and evil that even the most brilliant minds have failed to
detect its presence. Over the past fifty years, technological advances by
&quot;ungodly&quot; scientists have caused the alien presence to step up its
plans for the human race. In so doing, the veil of deception has begun to fall
away and the truth has finally been exposed. </P>
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The History of Man</FONT></I></H4>
<P> </P>
<P>The best place to start is at the beginning. The Bible tells us that in the
beginning God created the heaven and the earth. This is not at all what
happened. The matter which makes up the universe was never created. It has
always existed and will always continue to exist in one form or another. There
is no God who created everything from nothing, but there are life forms which
would have you believe that they are the messengers of that God. The earth was
formed as a result of the naturally occurring forces which have always been and
will always be. Life on this planet was not created but evolved, just as it has
done and will continue to do on billions of other planets which can support
life. </P>
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Gods &quot;create&quot; man</FONT></I></H4>
<P></P>
<P>After millions of years of evolution, the ancestors of modern man were
visited by an extraterrestrial race who saw in the primates that would become
man, a potential for use as servants or slaves. The extraterrestrial race would
later come to be known as &quot;Elohim;&quot; the Hebrew word for
&quot;Gods.&quot; This race of beings mixed strands of their own DNA with that
of the evolving man and &quot;created&quot; a hybrid that had an increased
intelligence capacity, a trait required by the Elohim to fulfill their agenda
for us. Initially, this hybrid mutation was unable to reproduce (similar to a
horse/donkey hybrid or mule) and the Elohim thought that they would be able to
control the population of the mutant man by keeping man sterile. Eventually the
head genetic engineer of the Elohim rebelled against the orders of his
superiors and genetically engineered the ability to reproduce into the mutant
man. This event is commonly called &quot;the fall of man&quot; by those who are
ignorant of what really took place.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The ability to reproduce was not the only trait which the Elohim tried to
keep from man. Genetically, the Elohim did not possess the genes which trigger
aging in humans and other animals. They had genetically altered their DNA so
that they did not age. When the leaders of the Elohim learned that man had been
given the ability to reproduce, they feared that the rebel genetic engineer
would alter their DNA to allow them to not age so they made it illegal for man
to be allowed in the facilities of the Elohim. Man had been &quot;cast
out&quot; of God's presence. </P>
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">War in Heaven</FONT></I></H4>
<P></P>
<P>The rebel genetic engineer was rebuked for his unauthorized manipulations of
man's DNA and became an outcast among his people. He believed that intelligent
life should not be enslaved but that it should be allowed to rule itself. Other
members of the Elohim supported the engineer and his philosophy and they
attempted to persuade the rest of the crew to not use the humans as slave
labor. As a result of their efforts, they were cast out as well. </P>
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Nephilim</FONT></I></H4>
<P></P>
<P>The rebel aliens were determined to remove the aging process from the DNA of
the human mutants but they were not allowed access to the genetic lab on the
alien ship. In an attempt to overcome this obstacle, the aliens mated with the
human hybrids and created children which possessed more of the alien DNA but
not the genes necessary to stop the aging process.</P>
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Flood</FONT></I></H4>
<P></P>
<P>The Elohim who had not rebeled discovered what had happened and decided that
the only way to stop the rebels would be to cause a flood to drown the mutant
humans and their offspring. The Elohim saved a group of humans which had not
mated with the rebel aliens. These humans would continue to serve the needs of
the Elohim for thousands of years to come.</P>
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Tower</FONT></I></H4>
<P></P>
<P>In time, man began to understand the ways of the Elohim. Observing and
assisting them with their space and air vehicles, they began to formulate a
plan to build their own vehicles and a launch tower by which they would
&quot;reach the heavens&quot; just as the Elohim did.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Elohim realized that if man were allowed to build these vehicles and
this tower their days as slave owners would soon be over. For this reason, they
once again genetically altered mankind, this time creating differences in
speech, appearance and eventually culture. In doing this, they were able to
keep man from becoming a threat to the Gods' status quo. For more information
see <A HREF="tower.html">The Tower of Babel.</A></P>
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Great &quot;I AM&quot;</FONT></I></H4>
<P></P>
<P>Eventually, the Elohim returned to their home planet, leaving mankind
millions of years more evolutionarily advanced than he naturally should have
been. Since that time, our planet has been visited by numerous other alien
races, some of which decided to camp out and use the sheep-like humans for
their own purposes.</P>
<P></P>
<P>One of the alien races is composed of various energy entities which dwell on
a plane of existence which cannot be detected by our limited ability to
perceive. These energy entities are able to convert the electro-magnetic
energies produced by the brain into an energy source for their own purposes.
They thrive on intense emotional states such as fear, guilt and passion. For
this reason they have found a home among the holy tabernacles of religion,
sucking up the emotional energies of the congregations. From the days of
Abraham, when one of these entities made a covenant to be the God of the Jews
in return for a piece of foreskin from the males of the tribe, these entities
have used mankind for their personal grocery store. </P>
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">Of Angels and Devils</FONT></I></H4>
<P>Several other alien species have been recruited by the energy entities to
perform various physical tasks to aid in controlling the human cattle.

 HEIGHT="168">The main henchmen are humanoid reptilians which work directly
under the control of the energy entities. These reptilian aliens hide behind
mentally projected masks, presenting themselves to the minds of men as angels
or demons, as the situation dictates. Evoking fear or passion to feed the
hunger of the &quot;Gods.&quot;</P>

<P>Today we read more and more about alien abductions and reproductive and
genetic experimentation being conducted on humans against their will by aliens.
The methods are the same as those used thousands of years ago. The
&quot;immaculate conception&quot; spoken of in the Bible is being repeated
today on alien spacecrafts around the world. Mary was impregnated with an
alien/human hybrid and Jesus was the link to connect humans with the Gods.
Jesus ascended into an awaiting spacecraft and millions of people await a
chance to join him in the clouds in his New Jerusalem. For more details see
<A HREF="borg.html">Jesus of Borg</A> and <A HREF="rupture.html">Independence
Day or &quot;The Rapture?&quot;</A></P>
<H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Conspiracy Against Humanity</FONT></I></H4>
<P></P>
<P>Religion has been used as a tool to keep man ignorant and at war with
himself in order to keep man from becoming a threat to the Gods. This was the
story thousands of years ago and it is the same today. The truth is that
&quot;God&quot; is nothing more than a tool of manipulation. Now that you know
the truth, don't stand for the deception! Break the chains of subservience that
these soul-vampires have forged for us! End the cycle of self-perpetuating
genocide by teaching your children to question the myths of religion. Let
&quot;ego&quot; be the battle cry and &quot;reason&quot; be the victory banner!
