<P><B>Many people are taught that without religion there would be no morality
in the world. They believe that the sense of right and wrong comes to us from
above through some invisible connection with the mind of God. What they often
fail to point out is that when their God's will is the only standard of right
and wrong, anything can be called &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; depending
on whether God says to do it or not (For some examples of God's twisted version
of morality see <A HREF="bloody.html">The Bloody Bible</A> or
<A HREF="sexbible.html">Sex in the Bible</A>). As we shall show, morality
should not be dependent on something as subjective as the will of an invisible
God which some can hear and others cannot. Nor should it be based on the
primitive writings of barbarians who blindly stumbled around attempting to
appease the will of that same unseen God.</B></P>
<IMG SRC="aynrand.jpeg" ALT="Our Long Duration Personal Savior: Ayn Rand"
 ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="223" BORDER="0"><P><B>We follow the philosophy
of objectivism as was laid out by the genius/subgenius; Ayn Rand. This
philosophy is based on reason and objectivity rather than emotion or
subjectivity. While the morality of religion is based on the will of God, the
morality of objectivism is based on the individual human life and that life's
happiness. Ayn Rand's vision of &quot;man as he should be,&quot; in her
literary works; &quot;Anthem,&quot; &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; and &quot;The
Fountainhead,&quot; has polished the tarnished image of the true spirit of man
into the shining, noble master of his destiny which he can be. Her brilliant
and courageous mind has revealed for the intellectual man of today a philosophy
of reason which will be the salvation for future generations of humanity. In
her own words, &quot;To live, man must hold three things as the supreme ruling
values of his life: Reason--Purpose--Self Esteem. Reason, as his only tool of
knowledge--Purpose, as his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed
to achieve--Self Esteem, as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent
to think and his person is worthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of
living.&quot; The end result of the achievement of these values is true

</P>
<P><B>Each of the main areas of philosophy involves a struggle to answer a
basic question. The answers to those questions are based on what is most
valuable to that philosophy. In religion, the highest value is obedience to the
will of God, while in objectivism the highest value is the individual human
life. As rational, individual human beings, objectivism is the most logical and
consistent philosophy for us to live by. It provides us with a rational
morality based on reason and the life of man rather than faith and the will of
an invisible God. We shall now give a brief overview of objectivism and how it
applies to morality without God.</B> </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><U>Metaphysics</U></I></H4>
<P><I>&quot;Wishing won't make it so.&quot; - Ayn Rand</I></P>
<P><B>The study of existence is the base of the study of philosophy.
Metaphysics asks: is the world we live in solid, ruled by natural laws and
facts or is it a world of smoke and illusion, where magic and miracles can
occur without explanation? Objectivism holds that we live in a solid world of
facts while religion teaches that the world is subject to the whims of
incomprehensible beings which are not subject to any laws other than their own
desires. To begin to understand metaphysics, the first thing we must establish
is that things actually exist. To establish this as a fact we must first exist
to ask the question (if we didn't exist we couldn't ask the question) and we
must also have the ability to conceive of the possibility of existence or
non-existence. If things didn't exist we wouldn't have that ability to
conceive. Existence exists. Reality is tangible. We hold that all things have a
rational explanation that is founded in reality and is subject to the laws of
nature.</B></P>
<P><I>&quot;Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.&quot; - Ayn Rand</I> </P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><U>Epistemology</U></I></H4>
<P><I>You can't eat you cake and have it, too.&quot; - Ayn Rand</I></P>
<P><B>How do we obtain knowledge? This is the science of epistemology. Is
knowledge acquired by a process of reason or is it obtained by heavenly
messenger or divine inspiration? To obtain knowledge, we must have the ability
to perceive reality (through our senses) we then must be able to process those
perceptions (through our conscious, cognitive ability to reason). The end
result of that processing is knowledge. Objectivism holds that the ability to
reason is essential to our acquisition of knowledge. Without reason we leave
ourselves open to the manipulations and deceptions of others. Religion teaches
us to not rely on our ability to reason (Proverbs 3:5). In other words it
intentionally makes us susceptible to the control of others (God, clergy, etc).
In religion, knowledge is acquired by divine inspiration (self-delusion) or the
inspiration of others (more delusions).</B></P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><U>Ethics</U></I></H4>
<P><I>&quot;Man is an end in himself.&quot; - Ayn Rand</I></P>
<P><B>The code of values which we use to guide our choices and actions are
known as ethics or morality. Our morality will determine the purpose and course
of our lives. In religion, morality is based on the will of God. If God wants
someone killed then killing that person would be considered &quot;good&quot;
whereas not killing that person would be considered &quot;evil&quot; because
obedience to God's will is the standard by which all other values are judged.
In Objectivism, the standard of good and evil is based on man's life. Man is a
valuable entity because he exists and he has the ability to reason. These
conditions are of value only because man lives and has the ability to make
choices. A dead man has no value in the philosophical sense. If something is
required for man's survival, then that thing is &quot;good.&quot; If something
is destructive to man's life, then that thing is &quot;evil.&quot; Happiness
and joy are the end result of those actions which add to man's life. Pain and
suffering come as a result of those actions which are destructive to man's
life. </B></P>
<P><B>Man has an ability which places him above all other living entities in
our sphere of existence and that is the ability to reason. Unlike other animals
who survive solely on instinct, man must discover the things he needs to
survive. Man must work to obtain the things he needs to survive (food, shelter,
etc.) and man must use reason to discover how to best obtain those needs. Man
controls his environment by the use of reason or man chooses to not use reason
and dies as a slave to his environment. That is the choice which the morality
of Objectivism places in front of us, to use reason or to not use reason (i.e.;
to rely on faith) to live or to die, to be free or to be a slave.</B></P>
<P><B>Objectivist morality can be described as the pursuit of rational
self-interest. In other words, doing those things that are in your own best
interest. This is not the spur-of-the-moment selfish immorality which the
faithful believe atheists are all a part of. Short-term happiness which leads
to long term destruction is not in the best rational self-interest and is thus
&quot;bad.&quot; The punishment for violation of objectivist morality is
enforced by reality: break the rules and your life suffers the consequences.
</B> </P>
<P><B>Using rationality, we can judge whether an action is beneficial to life
or destructive to it and can thus give it a scale of value by which we can
judge other alternative actions. A requirement of objectivism is that you make
judgements. You must use discrimination and judge those around you to determine
whether they are allies or enemies to your pursuit of life and happiness
(&quot;slack&quot;). Jesus taught that we should not judge so that we won't be
judged. Our philosophy is to &quot;judge and prepare to be judged.&quot; If you
are found unworthy of life, then nature will execute your just punishment and
you will be removed from the gene pool. Our primary tool for survival is our
ability to reason and if we choose to not use this tool, we won't survive for
long.</B></P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><U>Politics: The Individual vs. The Collective</U></I> 
</H4>
<P><I>&quot;Give me liberty or give me death.&quot; - Ayn Rand</I></P>
<P><B>One of the greatest philosophical questions has involved the value of the
individual versus the group or &quot;collective.&quot; Which is more important,
the life of the individual human being or the needs of some supernatural group
such as society, the community, the nation, the class, the race, etc? The
answer to this question will determine the proper social system (politics) for
man to live under. </B></P>
<P><B>Since the individual reasoning human is the basic unit of value and his
life is the source of morality, anything which interferes with a man's ability
to live (pursue his own rational self-interest) or prevents him from using his
main tool of survival: <I>reason</I>, must be considered to be
&quot;evil.&quot; For example, when the Bible tells us to not use reason
(Proverbs 3:5), it reveals that it is an <I>evil</I> book. Under the philosophy
of collectivism, the individual is subjugated to the group for the sake of the
illusionary &quot;common good.&quot; A person's value is thus determined by how
he serves the needs of the group. In these groups there are always an elite few
who dictate what the common good is. These elite few exert their own individual
wills over the masses, usually claiming some mystical reason for their
superiority (&quot;God talks to me&quot; or &quot;My wisdom is superior to
yours&quot;) and enslaves those who are members of these groups. The end result
of the evil of collectivism is the sacrifice of the rights of individual men to
pursue their own rational self-interest. In other words, collectivism is
evil.</B></P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><U>The Purpose of Government</U></I> </H4>
<P><B>When individual men choose to live together and deal with each other,
they form a &quot;society.&quot; In an society of individuals there is one rule
which must be enforced and that rule is &quot;no individual or group or
organization has the legal power to initiate the use of physical force against
other individuals or groups and to compel them to act against their own
voluntary choice.&quot; (Ayn Rand) This rule is the basis for objectivist law
and protects the rights of individuals to freely pursue their own happiness
without injust treatment or threat from others. Governments exist for the sole
purpose of preventing the<I>initiation</I> of force by anyone. The key word
here is the word &quot;initiate.&quot; A person has the legal right to use
force only to defend themselves when force has been initiated against them. The
government exists to provide the defensive force that individuals may not
personally possess. For example, the police exist to protect individuals from
criminals who initiate force to harm individuals and their property, the army
exists to protect individuals from invading foreign powers who would initiate
force to harm individuals and their property, and the courts exist to protect
and recompense individuals from those who initiate the use of force (possibly
by deception or fraud) to harm them and their property. Any use of the
government for purposes outside protecting individuals from the initiation of
force is an abuse of power and should not be tolerated by those who give the
government their authority: the individuals who consent to be governed.</B></P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><U>Irrational Discrimination</U></I> </H4>
<P><B>In order to determine whether the actions of an individual are good or
evil, it is necessary to judge or use discrimination. The word
&quot;discrimination&quot; is a fnord (evokes an irrational emotional response)
in our politically correct society. The kind of discrimination which is under
attack in the media is more accurately called &quot;irrational
discrimination.&quot; This is when a person discriminates, not on the
individual merits or actions of a person, but on their skin color, nationality,
sex, sexual preference or other collectivist grouping which devalue
individuals. Irrational discrimination is promoted by those who want to
reinforce the ideals of collectivism; that membership in a group is more
important than individual characteristics or actions.</B></P>
<P><B>An example of the irrational discrimination which collectivism promotes
is found in the poison of <I>RACISM</I>. Claiming that they have a genetic
superiority, the members of one race demand preferential treatment or respect
because of their race. In the Bible, the Hebrews believed they were God's
chosen race and they thought that gave them the right to murder other races and
steal their land. In more recent times, Hitler believed that the Aryan race was
superior to other races and exterminated the members of those other
&quot;inferior strains&quot; of humanity. In any group, there will be superior
individuals as well as inferior individuals. One of the greatest geniuses in
history; Albert Einstein, was a member of what Hitler called an inferior group
of humans (ironically, the same group that God had called his &quot;chosen
race;&quot; the Jews). How many other superior human individuals were herded
into the gas chambers to be slaughtered because of their race or other
irrational grouping? There is no such thing as a superior or inferior race or
other group. Groups don't do things, individuals do. Groups don't have rights,
individuals do. When objectivists judge the actions of people, they judge the
actions of individuals and not groups. It is only when individuals irrationally
mold themselves into the stereotype of a group that they assume the identity of
that group. But even then, when they choose to do something, they are to be
judged and held responsible for their own individual actions, not because they
appear to meet the stereotype of their group. </B></P>

Do?</U></I> </H4>
<P><B>What is &quot;good?&quot; What is &quot;evil?&quot; Here are some

</TABLE>
<P><B>It is fairly obvious that the morality which the Bible presents is not
only unjust but irrational. God himself says that his teachings are foolish and
irrational (1 Corinthians 1:19-21) because he doesn't want to save the wise men
of the world. Instead, this morally upright God; the source of all Christian
ethics, wants to save the irrational and foolish men who don't deserve saving
because they won't even use their &quot;God-given&quot; ability to reason. We
concede the issue and give this God the crown which he deserves: the dunce cap
which all fools who refuse to use reason should be forced to wear.</B></P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><U>Freethought</U></I> </H4>
<P><B>When you choose to place reason above faith and use your own independent
judgement regardless of what other people believe or want you to believe, you
are a freethinker. To be a freethinker has always required a degree of
resistance. One must be able to resist the fear of rejection (society frowns on
people who are independent thinkers) as well as the dogmas and opinions of
authority figures who claim to know what is true or right. (&quot;Question
Authority!&quot;) Freethought means that you don't believe things that you
don't have good evidence for or rational reason to believe in. This requires
that you value truth enough to place your fears or other emotional desires
second while placing reason first. Freethought is the key to liberating the
mind from the shackles of guilt, fear, ignorance, and superstition. </B></P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><U>Live the Life That is Worth Living</U></I> </H4>
<P><B>Objectivism and Freethought provide us with the foundation to allow
mankind to become the best that he can possibly be. In order to live that life
you must choose to use reason in every facet of your life. Don't be afraid to
use your mind and think for yourself. Don't shut down your mind because an
authority figure claims that he &quot;knows what is best.&quot; Stand firm for
reason with your values fully in view: life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.</B></P>
