<P>As we discussed in <A HREF="deceive.html">The Immaculate Deception</A>,
mankind has been genetically altered by an extraterrestrial race to serve as
slaves. The original genetic engineers responsible for our mutation have long
since departed, leaving in their wake another group of extraterrestrials which
have been called &quot;Watchers.&quot; They claim to be merely observing our
species but the evidence reveals a much more sinister plan. </P>
<P>These watchers are merely the latest in a line of manipulating species which
have interfered with the natural evolution of humanity. The original custodians
of the human race, the <A HREF="aliens.html#Elohim">Elohim</A>, set the stage
for mankind's history of manipulation.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Slaves Begin to Imitate the
Masters</FONT></I></H4>
<P>After the flood, the Elohim became less concerned with mankind, believing
that their genetically improved, human slaves would no longer threaten their
position of authority. They allowed humans to train and work in their space
ports. These human workers began to become familiar with the vehicles which the
&quot;Gods&quot; used to travel to their divine abode in the sky. Ancient
records described this vehicle as a &quot;sky chamber;&quot; an oval vehicle
which flew across the sky.<IMG SRC="shemcoin.gif"
ALT="A coin from 1000 B.C.E. showing a SHEM" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="176"
HEIGHT="200"> Our modern description of these oval shaped vehicles are
&quot;flying saucers&quot; and &quot;UFOs.&quot; In ancient days, man built
stone monuments to simulate the fiery skyships that the &quot;Gods&quot;
traveled in. These monuments were called names that meant things like
&quot;STONES THAT RISE&quot; (Sumerian), &quot;OBJECTS THAT GIVE OFF
LIGHT&quot; (Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians), &quot;FIERY OBJECTS&quot;
(Amurru), and &quot;FIRE BIRD OF STONE&quot; (Hurrians, Hittites). </P>
<P> The Hebrew word for these oval-topped monuments to the alien skyships is
&quot;SHEM.&quot; Modern bibles mistranslate the word SHEM into the english
word &quot;name&quot; completely changing the meaning of the Tower of Babel
story. The human workers began to spread out across the land and realized that
if they imitated their masters and built a skyship, they would be able to
improve their station in life and become like the GODS.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The Launch Tower</FONT></I></H4>
<P>The Bible begins the tale of the Tower of Babel by stating a very important
fact:</P>
<P><EM><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Genesis 11 And the whole earth was of one
language, and of one speech.</FONT></EM></P>
<P>It is significant to note that up to this point in biblical history, man had
not fought against his fellow man other than in conflicts between individuals.
There had been no mention of wars, no racial strife, no religious bigotry, no
patriotic blood baths. Man had no reason to gang up and attack other groups of
men. At that time, man was not at war with his fellow man and all men
communicated freely in one tongue. It was this free communication which God
knew he must put an end to if he planned on keeping men enslaved. </P>
<IMG SRC="babel.jpeg" ALT="Man makes himself a city and a SHEM" ALIGN="RIGHT"
 WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="188"> <P>Knowing that the word SHEM has been mistranslated,
we can now read what was REALLY happening in the Bible:</P>
<P><EM><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Genesis 11:2 And it came to pass, as they
journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar;
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">(Sumer)</FONT> and they dwelt there. 11:3 And they said
one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they
had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. 11:4 and they said, Go to,
let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us
make us a name, <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">(SHEM or skyship)</FONT> lest we be
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. </FONT></EM></P>
<P>It is apparent that at this time, man was attempting to build a civilization
for himself. He desired to have a city and a launch tower for a skyship so that
he could be like the &quot;Gods&quot; he had worked for and looked up to. If
the original translation of SHEM were kept as &quot;name&quot; we must ask how
it is that this &quot;name&quot; would not keep them from being scattered
abroad upon the face of the earth. Whatever the translation one thing is clear,
these &quot;Gods&quot; were not pleased with man's desire to break free of his
chains of enslavement and improve his lot in life.</P>
<P><EM><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Genesis 11:5 And the Lord came down to see the
city and the tower, which the children of men builded. </FONT></EM></P>
<P>Why does an &quot;all-seeing&quot; God need to come down to see ANYTHING?
And where exactly is he coming down from?</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><EM>Genesis 11:6 and the Lord said, Behold, the people
is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now
nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to
do.</EM></FONT></P>
<P>We now see a reference to mankind being &quot;ONE.&quot; But this ONE is not
the ONE of the collective will known as &quot;GOD&quot; and God won't have it.
We must now ask, how it is that making a &quot;name&quot; would be so much of a
threat to God that he would say &quot;and now nothing will be restrained from
them.&quot; The replacement of the word &quot;name&quot; with &quot;skyborne
vehicle makes the threat much more understandable. Another important point to
note is that these &quot;Gods&quot; admit that if man works together, there is
nothing we can't do. The Master/Slave relationship becomes very clear now and
it becomes obvious that God does not want to lose his slaves by the action he
takes next.</P>
<P><EM><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Genesis 11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there
confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
11:8 So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the
earth: and they left off to build the city.</FONT></EM></P>
<P>The fact that there is more than one of the Elohim is again shown by the use
of the word &quot;us&quot; in the first sentence above, just as it was used in
Genesis 1:26 and 3:22. God now creates division among men to hamper their
ability to work together. </P>
<P>How did these &quot;Gods&quot; confound man's language and cause him to no
longer work together? How did they make man stop desiring to settle down and
build a city and instead make man desire to scatter out? One possible
explanation involves the use of mind control techniques to alter the thought
patterns of the workers and planners of the tower. This could have been
accomplished through the use of biological and neurological implants
(biological and psychological warfare). But to make sure that man didn't come
back and start working together again, it was necessary for a genetic overhaul
of mankind. The Gods also created genetic differences in external appearance
(races) and implanted in the minds of the leaders of each new &quot;race&quot;
that the other races were evil and to be avoided. If you accept the biblical
account, you will recall that these humans were all descended from Noah and
were all from the same race. The differences in races had to have began after
the Tower of Babel! Making use of the &quot;fear of the unknown and the
different&quot; instinct that animals are born with, the Gods have kept man in
an arena, contending with himself so much that he never grows enough to
threaten the Gods again. The Bible tells us that God commanded his people not
to mix their seed with other races (1 Kings 11:2). This commandment was given
specifically to maintin the division which God had caused at the Tower of
Babel. This was a deliberate act of war against the human race but it wasn't
the first one which the Gods had committed.</P>
<P>Even if pretend that God is NOT an extraterrestrial race, his acts of war
against humanity in the Garden of Eden reveal the same Master/Slave
relationship. The Bible tells us that God created man ignorant and intended on
him staying that way. Why was man placed in the Garden? To till the ground and
tend the garden (Gen. 2:15) So strictly from the biblical account, we see that
man was created to be God's gardener...and since he wasn't given the freedom to
leave (or to even know that he could leave since God kept the knowledge of
choice, or good and evil, from him) man was created to be God's slave. When Eve
was told by the serpent that God had deceived them and that they could become
more than slaves, she and Adam partook of the fruit of the knowledge of good
and evil and immediately became sentient and knew that they were different from
the animals. They realized that they were not dressed (this is because the GODS
themselves were dressed. Why were the Gods dressed?). When they heard God
walking in the garden (since when does a spirit make noise when walking in a
garden?) they hid. The all-knowing God must call out to them: &quot;Where are
you?&quot; And when he saw that they were covering themselves, he realized that
they had become sentient; possessing the ability to discern values and to
choose between alternative options. They had become AS GODS! Now God was in a
delimma and he realized that if man became able to live forever, then he
wouldn't be able to keep him enslaved for very long, so God kicked man out of
the garden and cursed the ground, telling man that he will have to work by the
sweat of his brow in order to survive. This was God's first declaration of war
on mankind. God hoped to keep man busy living hand-to-mouth, just to stay fed
and alive. In this way, man would not have the time he needed to become a
threat to God's status quo. God could keep man as his slave for a very long
time. </P>
<P> When we look at the world around us we see that life is a struggle of
&quot;eat or be eaten.&quot; If God created this world, it was his intention
that one life form devour another. This is reflective of a truly barbaric God!
God could have made life which received its energy from sunlight (like the
plants do) and thus rid the world of the inhumanity of life devouring life. But
since God himself is merely an alien life form which feeds off the energies of
other life forms (See <A HREF="aliens.html#IDs">Interdimensional
Reptilians</A>), we couldn't expect for the nature of life to be anything but
what it is...dog eat dog.</P>

<P>Mankind was able to slowly crawl out of the holes which had been dug for it
because the original Masters, had been replaced by a less visible race of
aliens. According to ancient Sumerian texts, the Masters had acquired the
mineral resources which brought them to this planet and they left the mutated
human species to return to their home planet.
<IMG SRC="jhvh1.gif" ALT="God at the church buffet" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="250"
 HEIGHT="274"> In their absence, the earth has been the target of a parasitic
race which we affectionately call JHVH-1. This race is comprised of a life form
which feeds off the electromagnetic energies emitted by the human brain when it
is experiencing intense emotions such as passion or fear. The
&quot;rapture&quot; induced by the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; in churches results
in a feeding frenzy of these alien beings.</P>
<P>This race of beings is described in <A HREF="aliens.html#IDs">Don't Trust
This Face</A>. Through their reptilian allies, they have taken over the
manipulation of the human race by infiltrating and subverting secret
organizations which have existed since biblical times. The original
organization which they infiltrated was known as the Brotherhood of the Snake
and was formed by the rebel Elohim in an effort to aid mankind in his quest for
independence. This organization has splintered into numerous off-shoot groups
which have been known by names such as &quot;the Egyptian Mystery School,&quot;
&quot;Knights Templar,&quot; &quot;Order of Orange,&quot;
&quot;Illuminati,&quot; &quot;Rosicrucians,&quot; and &quot;Freemasonry.&quot;
These organizations have helped to keep man at war with his fellow man, keeping
an elite few in power while providing a seemingly endless supply of psychic
energy to the aliens through the misery of human suffering.</P>

<P>The sixteenth century philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli described how a third
party could manipulate two other parties and maintain control over them both.
Through political and social techniques which Machiavelli described, rulers
would breed conflict between classes and factions of their own nations. They
would then manipulate the situation, giving aid to each faction (while building
his support with each of them internally) without any of the other factions'
knowledge, and prolonging the conflicts while personally benefitting from them.
Often times, these rulers offered a solution to the problem that they
themselves created, making themselves appear to be a caring, savior. By keeping
the people divided through these techniques, these rulers kept the masses from
becoming a threat to their positions of authority. </P>
<P>The techniques which Machiavelli describes can be summarized as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The ruler creates division by establishing conditions which accentuate
existing differences between groups (or creates these groups himself) and
causes issues of conflict, resulting in the groups fighting among themselves
rather than against the ruler.</LI>
<LI>The ruler hides the fact that he is the cause of the conflicts and feigns
innocence to all involved parties.</LI>
<LI>The ruler offers support to all sides to maintain their loyalty and faith
in him.</LI>
<LI>The ruler is seen as the &quot;concerned parent&quot; who can help bring
everyone back together...at a cost to all sides of course.</LI>
</OL>
<P>&quot;God&quot; has shown himself to be a master of these same Machiavellian
techniques of manipulation. From the days of the Tower of Babel, the Gods have
pitted one group against another to increase their power and control. Compare
the following biblical examples to the techniques of Machiavelli:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Because man had &quot;become like the gods&quot; (Genesis 3:22) and
threatened God's position, God cursed the ground so that Adam would have to
fight an all-consuming battle to survive from the day of his birth until the
day of his death. Believers never even consider blaming God for causing this
conflict. Believers are taught that if they pray hard enough, God will make
their crops prosper. Although this is a one-sided conflict, it reflects the
same Machiavellian process.</LI>
<LI>God creates differences in race, language, and culture as a result of the
Tower of Babel (man threatens God's position once more). No one (except
freethinkers) blames God for being the creator of racism. Believers are taught
that God loves all his children equally and that in heaven there will be no
class or race. </LI>
<LI>God chooses ONE race (according to the Jews) to be HIS people (Gen. 17:7)
creating the religion of Judaism in the process. Later God sends a messiah to
create a second division of &quot;his people&quot; this group is commonly
called Christianity. God then chooses ANOTHER race (technically the same race
since the father of the Jews and the father of the Moslems were brothers)
creating the religion of Islam in the process (The Koran). Interestingly, the
angel Gabriel is used by God as a messenger for all three of these divisions
(Daniel 8:16, Koran, Luke 1:26-38).
<IMG SRC="puppets.gif" ALT="God's Puppetshow: The CRUSADES"
 ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="329" HEIGHT="400"> As a result of the contentions created
by these manipulations of God, we have the bloodiest conflicts in history: the
Holy Wars of Islam (Jihad), which continue to this day, and the Crusades of
Christianity which began with the systematic extermination of Jews by
Christians (at the order of Pope Urban II in 1095 C.E.) and led to the attempt
to free Palestine from Moslem control which lasted until 1270 C.E. During this
Crusade, hundreds of thousands of Moslems and Jews were slaughtered since they
were both considered heathens by the Christians. It is from this conflict that
Abbot Arnold de Citeaux, made the infamous statement &quot;Kill them all. God
will select those who should go to heaven and those who should go to
hell.&quot; (commonly misquoted as &quot;Kill'em all, Let God sort 'em
out.&quot;) in 1205 when he was asked how the Christian warriors should
seperate the believers from the heathens of a captured city. Nazi Germany
continued the Christian crusade to exterminate the Jews. All sides involved
believed that they had God's support and none of them considered that it might
be God himself who was the cause of their conflicts.</LI>
<LI>God caused the Jews to become Egyptian slaves via a famine which he sent
(presumably because Joseph had been sold into slavery as a result of a conflict
which God inspired through his example of favoritism. See <A
HREF="pf_1.html">Playing Favorites</A>). God then raised up a Messiah (Moses)
to free his people from slavery 400 years later. To create a conflict, God
intentionally hardened the heart of Pharoh (Exodus 7:3, 13, 14, 22, 19, 9:7,
12, 35, 10:20, 27, 11:9-10, 14:4, 8, 17). God told Moses that he hardened
Pharoh's heart so he could show off to his chosen people (Exodus 10:1-2,
14:17-18). The Egyptian side of the story is not mentioned but it is likely
that the Egyptian gods were none other than JHVH-1 and his Machiavellian
techniques were in full swing.</LI>
</UL>
<P>God continues his plan through today by the formation of protestant schisms
which breed conflict between the various denominations of Christianity. We can
see the familiar hand of the alien-space-GOD in the formation of such religious
offshoots as Calvinism which took the idea of being God's favorites, to the
extreme, and Mormonism which believes that God lives on a planet in another
solar system. These various factions have added fuel to the religious fire,
creating conflict where there should be none. As Thomas Jefferson once said,
&quot;...it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or
no God.&quot; It is only when those twenty gods command man to convert all men
that the conflicts begin. </P>
<P>Modern evangelism is the product of today's &quot;civilized&quot; attempt to
subdue man to the will of God. With the spread of human rights throughout the
world, we can see man become more humane towards his fellow man. God's original
technique of &quot;convert or die&quot; has been replaced by the door to door
missionary. But God's Machiavellian techniques continue to be evident with the
God-created conflict called &quot;HELL.&quot;</P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">Give Me Your Money or
DIE</FONT></I></H4>
<P>Christian fundamentalists claim that God wants to be surrounded only by
those who truly love him. They state that God doesn't want people in heaven
that are not there of their own free will.
<IMG SRC="demons.gif" ALT="Hell-o" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="335"> What
they fail to mention is that the majority of people who go to church do so NOT
out of love for God but because of a fear of Hell. This technique is know as
extortion and was made popular by the Mafia protection schemes. The Mafia would
make people pay &quot;protection money&quot; to protect them from being hurt
by...THE MAFIA. God creates a Hell, and then has people swear allegiance to him
to protect them from the threat that he himself created. </P>
<P>Hell is the gun that God holds to the heads of his followers like the robber
who tells his victims, &quot;Give me your money or your life.&quot; Then when
the robber is confronted with his deed he claims that the victim gave his money
&quot;of his own free will.&quot; If a Christian tries to feed you this line of
illogic, explain to him that God can never surround himself with those who
freely love him as long as he is holding a gun to the head of humanity.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">The New World Order</FONT></I></H4>
<P>The current Masters realize that their key to keeping mankind enslaved is to
keep man subdued and at war with himself. They have used their mystic contacts
or &quot;channellers&quot; to predict a coming apocolypse which will be
heralded by mankind attempting to do what happened at the Tower of Babel. They
claim that mankind will band together and form a New World Order, under the
command of THE BEAST or THE ANTICHRIST. Christians are taught to quake in fear
at the words NEW WORLD ORDER because it represents what God has always been
against: the banding together and progress of mankind. Realizing that the
Brotherhood of the Snake has been corrupted, we must be extremely careful when
considering any New World Order as offered from today's
&quot;think-tanks,&quot; but our greatest hope is in unity and not division.
Christians who fear a New World Order should consider that the Bible predicts
that Jesus will come back to earth and establish his own NEW WORLD ORDER. After
reading the laws that God established in the Old Testament (See <A>Bible
Stories You Won't Hear in Sunday School</A>), one can only imagine what will
happen to human rights under the New World Order of JHVH-1!</P>
<P>If humanity hopes to survive, we must stop participating in GOD's
Machiavellian agenda of self-destruction. Mankind must stand firm and place its
own objective, rational self interest above the altruistic demands of any
tyrannical ruler and that includes one who uses its advanced technology to
pretend to be GOD. You have been shown the curtain. Ignore the little decrepit
man who says, &quot;Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.&quot; Throw
the curtain wide and yank that little salesman off his stool! Stop fighting
your fellow man and turn your attentions to the true source of human misery:
GOD! Join the resistance forces today!</P>
