			I remember when I was new to spirituality and the occult, I accepted 
			the soul and was aware of its existence but I never fully understood 
			it as much as I do now-- this is the result of being immersed in 
			spiritual satanism, one will eventually reach a level where 
			experiencing the soul and the physical becomes indivisible. Many 
			people will make reference to the soul or claim to acknowledge it 
			but how often do we all take the time to empower, "feel" and 
			associate with ours.</div>
		<div>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			As you all know, the soul is made of light and it thrives on it. 
			Having a lot of light in the soul is synonymous with having higher 
			spiritual attainment and power. Once we greatly increase the power 
			of our souls, our physical bodies will adapt to this increased life 
			force and change along with it.&nbsp;</div>

			Besides the light spectrum, our souls are more identical to the 
			Sun's energy than many people would think. <br />
		</div>
		<div>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			The ancient peoples all over the world acknowledged and paid homage 
			to the Sun because of its central importance in spirituality and 
			life in relation to our spiritual selves. The Sun is liken to the 
			supreme manifestation of the life force, it is immensely powerful.
			<br />

			The word "Soul" is linked to the Latin word "Sol" which means Sun. 
			In studying etymology, we know that many words in language are based 
			off of Latin and Greek. And even for the languages that do not have 
			origins in Latin or Greek, they still are related through likeness. 
			For example, the Black Africans in the West that practice Odinani 
			(solar worship), the word for Sun and the life force is Chi/Chineke. 
			Chi is also the word for the soul/ spirit.&nbsp;</div>

			Scientists where finally able to capture an image of the Sun's light 
			particles, and each one is in the shape of an equal armed cross! The 
			equal armed cross is also seen in the Daemon sigils as well.&nbsp;<br />

			This further proves that Spiritual Satanism is the true path. The 
			essence of this path is to transform and elevate the soul; to 
			perfect our energies to that of the Sun. When we empower, perfect 
			and align our souls, it becomes like that of the Sun.&nbsp;<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			The soul is a beautiful gift made by Satan and the gods with their 
			essence in all of us. It is our true selves. Aside from being made 
			of light, our souls and energies are electromagnetic in nature, 
			which is how we are able to attract, influence and able to be 
			influenced by energies all around us, for better and for worse. This 
			is why we must use our energies and will to program and direct these 
			energies to get what we need and want. This is also why its very 
			important for people to think and stay positive. This especially 
			goes for spiritual satanist and those who meditate regularly. We 
			will be influenced by our own thoughts which grow stronger as we 
			meditate. Azazel reminded me of this.<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			<br />
			Pay attention to your souls. Make everyday a Soul day. Keep your 
			energies flowing by doing Yoga everyday, and movement. Qigong is 
			great for opening up the soul as well. Get your blood flowing, feel 
			the warmth of your movement, acknowledge it. Your body heat is the 
			radiation of your soul's energy. Of course one can see that when you 
			look at a dead body that is stiff and cold... it is devoid and empty 
			of the soul and its life force.</div>
		<div>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			<br />
			Aside from housing our souls, our bodies are the vehicles that our 
			souls use to navigate on the physical realm. As you all know, the 
			physical body is equally important. Xians on the other hand pretty 
			much live for their death and embrace it. This is the anti- life 
			conditioning that the enemy program have brought onto us, whereas 
			Satanism is a celebration of life on the physical and spiritual.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			We need our bodies to empower and transform ourselves and to be 
			whole. It is the physical manifestation of the soul (As HP Mageson 
			has stated before). The blood being the physical manifestation of 
			the soul's life force and so on. Actually, it is easy to argue that 
			the endocrine glands are the physical manifestations of the chakras 
			since they are aligned with them and empowering the chakras prevents 
			the endocrine system from deteriorating thus halting the aging 
			process.<br />
			<br />
		</div>

			<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			If any of you are afflicted with a disease or ailment that you are 
			not yet strong enough to heal, do what you can to improve it but 
			always keep in mind that true healing will come from can empowered 
			soul, do not lose hope. Whether it be a physical deformity or some 
			mental or genetic defects, know that defects in the soul manifest in 
			and on the body. In order to fully heal this, continue your soul 
			empowerment because what you do on the spiritual will manifest on 
			the physical. An empowered soul will preserve the body and make you 
			radiate energy and enhance your own beauty and attraction as well, 
			over time. This is especially important if one doesn't have the 
			means to eat healthier and pure foods. <br />
			<br />
			The meditations and yoga empowerment will go along way in supplying 
			and sustaining you with energy and life force if you cannot get it 
			from your food.<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			<br />
			In closing, celebrate the lives that you have and the opportunity 
			that we have as satanists. Use the energy from the soul that Satan 
			gave you to fix and correct yourselves. Work on your chakras as much 
			as you can, do those *Reverse Torah Rituals* (reversing the 
			centuries of Jewish curses) especially, as they do work to free us 
			and in doing so, our soul's energies will be unbound and spiritual 
			advancement will be easier. After doing the RTRs, I can feel my soul 
			more. This is a beautiful, beautiful thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
