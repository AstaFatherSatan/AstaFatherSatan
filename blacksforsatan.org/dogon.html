		The Dogon people are the last group within the black race to hold on to 
		the Egyptian culture bestowed to us by our ancient and original gods. In 
		analyzing this, we see the remains of a beautiful satanic culture based 
		on understanding the soul, the gods and the world around us. <br />
		<br />
		Unfortunately a portion of the Dogon population practice Islam and 
		Christianity, the filthy and destructive programs that are connected to 
		the enemy agenda.<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		The Dogon cosmology and creation story, deities, language, symbolism, 
		culture and civic inclinations are all similar to ancient Egypt. The 
		priesthood also is connected. As was mentioned before, Nommo in Dogon 
		beliefs is the creator god associated with primordial waters. The name 
		Nommo means water essentially. Nommo is similar to Nammu, another 
		primordial "water" being representing the feminine and creation in 
		Sumerian lore. <br />
		<br />
		The primordial water theme is ever present in all gentile spiritual 
		narratives, allegories and symbolism such as Oannes, Dagon and Mami Wata 
		and other mermaid like beings. This is the Shakti force. <br />
		<br />
		<br />
		Curiously, the Dogon cosmology and symbolism ties in and is 
		interconnected with scientific concept and astronomical occurrences as 
		documented in many books and articles on these people. <br />
		<br />
		Our Egyptian gods gave this knowledge to the gentile races and you can 
		see this in deeper Africa with the Dogons, the Yoruba and in certain 
		areas in South Africa. There was a Pyramidal structure found in South 
		Africa aligned with the pyramid of Giza, as documented in the book " 
		Temples of the African gods."<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		Its no wonder many Black people feel connected to the Egyptian daemon gods and 
		Kemetic culture. <br />
		<br />
		I remember before coming to spiritual satanism, when I was deeply into 
		general paganism, I chose to immerse myself in Egyptian mythology and 
		then I started to feel attracted to that pantheon of gods and my overall 
		spiritual self. Shortly after, I was directed to the JoyofSatan.&nbsp; Many 
		of the Egyptian daemon gods are still in the black racial memory. This 
		relates to many of the Black Joy of Satan members coming to Satan 
		because of an interest in the old daemon gods...<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		Hail Satan!
