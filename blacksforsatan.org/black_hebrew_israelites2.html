					We already are aware that the Bible is a book of stolen 
					material and lies put together by the Jewish menace as a 
					means to enslave and destroy the gentiles (non-Jews), but as 
					was said, it is important to understand exactly the material 
					inside of it to debunk the BHI claim. So many blacks relate 
					and cling on to this movement and so it is important to 
					understand the whole ideology.</div>

					According to the Judeo-Christian bible, Israelites were the 
					descendants of the sons of Jacob and whose name was changed

					were called the children of Israel. Israel is everywhere in 
					the bible and so any group of people claiming to be the 
					Israelites are seeking to feel as if they are the chosen 
					ones. Another example is in British Israelism. They mimic 
					the BHI in that they believe that europeans are the original 
					Israelites.</div>
