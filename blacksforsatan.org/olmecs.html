		<p>Aside from The Black Hebrew Israelites, the Moors and so on. There 
		are other claims such as the Olmecs were a Black civilization.</p>
		<p>Again we have the appropriating of another race's culture.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The situation with the Olmecs is the Afrocentrics argue that the 
		Olmecs were Black people that occupied the Americas just because there 
		are large Olmec stone statue heads that look similar to African head 
		shapes. Lets not forget that there are many Olmec Descendants who look 
		like the statue depictions more than a Black African, such as with 
		thicker lips and broad noses... DNA studies also show that there are no 
		links to the Olmecs and Black Africans (from tests done on the Olmec 
		remains. There are also NO evidence of African Culture in any of the 
		Olmec civilizations. No remnants of African culture and artifacts 
		whatsoever. If the Olmecs were a Black African civilization, we would 
		find evidence and artifacts from them. But there is none. The Olmec 
		civilization was of the Mongoloid people with Asiatic ancestry. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Here is a link to a wonderful article PLUS 3 videos proving the 
		Olmecs were NOT black African.<br />
		<a href="http://damongerardcorrie.blogspot.com/2014/05/new-olmecs-were-amerindians-not.html?m=1">
		<span class="auto-style6">The Olmecs were not Black </span></a></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;Its important to mention that there have been claims of "Black 
		Athena", that Beethoven (the white German composer) was Black and that 
		the Chinese were originally Black, that the Black race taught the White 
		race everything they know, etc, etc and the list goes on. NONE of this 
		can be proven, they are just based on an inferiority complex and history 
		that only served as an ego boost. This is 
		exactly what happens when people are separated from their culture, 
		history and homelands- you have many false identity arguments and a need 
		to take on another form of identity just to feel better about the self 
		and race.</p>
		<p>Black people do not need to feel that way- we have our own culture 
		alongside the Satan and our ancient Gods.&nbsp; It is the Jew that has made 
		Black people feel inferior and curse them in the Bible so much so that 
		it has caused spiritual and psychological association with these curses 
		and the racism and hate that is in the Bible. In the Bible the Jews 
		assert that the Black race is eternally cursed to be slaves... </p>
