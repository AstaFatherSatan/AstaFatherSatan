		<p>It's time for us to finally visit the subject of the Egyptians. This 
		is a hot topic for sure as both Black people and White people are 
		putting forth claims- Blacks saying that Egypt was an all black 
		civilization and Whites saying that it wasn't, etc. I want to say that it 
		is normal for people to want to feel good about themselves or feel 
		uplifted by the accomplishments of their ancestors and blood, etc.&nbsp; This 
		is all normal. </p>
		<p class="auto-style6">The case is, Africa has always been a 
		multi-racial and diverse continent. Whether home to Blacks, Black 
		sub-groups, Whites and Eurasians, Arabs, Asiatics and those in between.
		</p>
		<p class="auto-style6">&nbsp;<span class="auto-style7">Ancient Egypt is 
		several thousand years old and I do mean several. We're talking more 
		than 30,000. The pyramids have been found to be 40,000 or more years old 
		and they seem to predate the ancient&nbsp;Egyptian&nbsp;civilization. It is 
		obvious that the&nbsp;extraterrestrial gods helped to build the pyramids. 
		Scientists today still cannot quite figure out how it was&nbsp;built...
		</span></p>
		<p>Given that information, why is it not taken into huge consideration 
		that there were more than once race inhabiting Egypt 
		at&nbsp;different&nbsp;periods of time? Also, why&nbsp;aren't Black people looking into 
		the fact that the Egyptian culture is seen in other places in Africa...?
		</p>
		<p>Of course the Black race was in Egypt at some point thousands of 
		years after it was settled.&nbsp;Many of the Black race were trained and 
		taught the Egyptian knowledge and took it with them as they migrated. 
		This is seen with the Black Yorubas, the Bantu and the&nbsp;Dogon. The 
		Egyptian priesthood of the ancient&nbsp;Egyptians and the Dogon shows they 
		came from the same place. However there is no disputing that the 
		Pre-Dynastic mummies that were found were white.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>All the races that lived in Africa, Egypt included, were given the 
		same knowledge and culture. It came from the same source. The Gods 
		interacted with the Gentile races in Egypt, which was the center of the 
		Egyptian culture and knowledge. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;<a href="egyptian_black.html"><span class="auto-style5">The 
		Egyptian Gods and the Black Race </span></a></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A quote from a clergy member that further expands on what&nbsp; was 
		mentioned: </p>
		<p>"With Ancient Egypt its known the Egyptian records that Egypt was 
		settled by the Shemsu Hor, the White People who came out of the east. 
		The pre dynastic tombs are of White Peoples. The Dynastic period was the 
		last part of their history. The very ancient ethnic Egyptians the 
		Coptic's are mainly White like the Kurds and others.&nbsp;The pre dynastic 
		Egyptian tombs showed they were white.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;It was an ancient tradition to show men with red skin and women 
		as white. The Greeks did the same. At some point a lot of race mixing 
		took over. Despite the Egyptians attempt to stop it. Today you can see 
		all kinds of people in Egypt. Native Whites from the Coptic's who are 
		from the ancient world as a community, mixed race people,&nbsp;Blacks&nbsp;and 
		on." The last Pharaoh was Nubian but that was the end point of Egyptian 
		civilization. He reigned for a few years then the Assyrians invaded. And 
		took half of Egypt, then came the Persian's not too long later, then the 
		Greeks, Roman's and Arabs" </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The amount of information circulating around on the Ancient Egyptians 
		is vast. Im not going to go over every bit of information just to try to 
		prove or dismiss something as complex as this topic, even though 
		evidence shows that Ancient Egypt was not an all Black civilization from 
		the beginning. The fact is Black people are connected to Ancient Egypt, 
		in the form of our Egypyian Daemon gods, their culture and the sacred 
		knowledge they preserved and that's enough for me. </p>
