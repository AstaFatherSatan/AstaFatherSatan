		<h1 class="auto-style12">
		<span class="auto-style2" style="line-height: 1.22em; word-spacing: normal;">
		Music, dance and storytelling were the means in which our ancestors 
		preserved their history. The blacks race's <br />
		history was based in oral 
		traditions and the keepers of these traditions were griots and bards.</span><span class="auto-style3"><br class="auto-style4" clear="none" style="line-height: 1.22em;" />
		</span></h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style13">Traditional African dance is correspondent to 
		Yoga.</h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style5">
		<a data-saferedirecturl="../google.com/url_q=http_//www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Yoga2.html_source=gmail_ust=154826.html" href="../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Yoga2.html" target="_blank">
		<span class="auto-style14">More about Yoga</span></a></h1>
		<p class="auto-style5">&nbsp;</p>
		<span class="auto-style12">
		<h1 class="auto-style5">
		<span style="line-height: 1.22em; word-spacing: normal;">All the gentile 
		races had their own form of this practice though it was not called Yoga. 
		The Asians such as the <br />
		Chinese have utilized Qigong, Tai chi and related 
		practices, the Aryans and East Asians performed what we generally
		know 
		as Yoga and the Blacks specifically identified with dance.</span></h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style5">
		<span style="line-height: 1.22em; word-spacing: normal;">Dancing and 
		body movement were performed by all the gentile races in some way or 
		form.&nbsp;All of these emphasized
		total body awareness, union within the 
		mind body and soul, developing physical strength and capability as well 
		as <br />
		achieving a spiritual state of being.</span></h1>
		<p class="auto-style5">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="auto-style5"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">Traditional 
		African dance is powerful and physical and depends on coordination and 
		synchronization within body. Its utilizes the concepts of polyrhythms in 
		which the shoulders, chests, pelvis, arms and legs may move with 
		different rhythms in the music, and total body articulation and 
		isolation of parts of the body.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style5"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">The 
		traditional movements also include, depending on the dance, hip and 
		rhythmic gyrations of the back and lower spine,movement of the hips to 
		open up the hip centers, body shaking, movements of the cranial with 
		knees bent (as seen in many asian spiritual practices such as Qigong) 
		and foot stomping.&nbsp;<br clear="none" style="line-height: 1.22em;" />
		</span></span></p>
		<p class="auto-style5"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">
		<span class="auto-style12">With further 
		observation of the dances, I have seen many similarities between yoga 
		and the traditional dances such as use of mudras, rolling of the neck, 
		the cobra pose, spinal twists, the warrior pose and other yogic 
		positions but this is performed while maintaining constant movement of 
		the body. The movements range from simple and regal to complex and fast. 
		This takes control and connection.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="auto-style12"></p>
		<p class="auto-style5"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">
		<br clear="none" style="line-height: 1.22em;" />
		</span></span></p>
		<p class="auto-style13"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">One wonderful 
		example of this is the African dance called the Yanvalou. It originated 
		in West Africa and was brought over to Haiti during the Trans-Atlantic 
		african slave trade along with many other traditional and african pagan 
		religion.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.22em; word-spacing: normal;">The 
		Voodoo based practices today in Haiti and in some parts of the Americas 
		was derived from the official Vodun religion based on the wisdom of the 
		Serpent, in Africa.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style13">
		<a href="voodoo.html">
		<span class="auto-style14">Voodoo</span></a></p>
		<p class="auto-style13">
		&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="auto-style13">
		The Yanvalou is 
		a Vodun dance that invokes and calls upon the all important 
		serpent/snake deity called Damballah who brings upon wisdom and purity. 
		Damballa is another name for the kundalini serpent.<br clear="none" style="line-height: 1.22em;" />
		</p>
		<p class="auto-style13">
		Yanvalou dance 
		is said to be one of the most important of the Vodun based dances and is 
		usually performed before ritual. The dance consists of spinal twists and 
		manipulations, Contractions of the solar plexus, undulations of the back 
		from the base of the spine upwards while knees slightly bent and 
		releasing of the chest. This mimics the movements of the serpent or the<span>&nbsp;</span> 
		waves of the sea.&nbsp;<br clear="none" style="line-height: 1.22em;" />
		</p>
		<p class="auto-style13">
		The Yanvalou is 
		performed at a slower tempo so that trance can be obtained. Dancers 
		allow their body to relax while working at the same time and expand the 
		breath movement throughout the entire body on a vertical axis. With 
		Yanvalou and other derived dances such as zepol, banda gede, mayi and 
		parigol, I note that many of these dances in tribute to "Damballah" put 
		emphasis on the lower spine, hip and sacral area while also grinding, 
		contracting and moving the pelvic area to stimulate the sexual energy.</p>
		<p class="auto-style13">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="auto-style13">In speaking of the kundalini and of spiritual 
		energy being invoked through movement, In Nigeria during Yoruba 
		ceremonies, many describe their progress of their shamanistic dancing 
		culminates in a surge of heat rising from the base of the spine.&nbsp;</p>
		<span class="auto-style12">
		<p class="auto-style5">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="auto-style5">
		<span style="line-height: 1.22em; word-spacing: normal;">The Kalahari 
		Bushmen in Namibia, also speak of vital spiritual energy which they call 
		N'um. They call it the vital energy residing at the base of the spine 
		and bursts out of the crown of the head. They are said to enter a trance 
		and then 'heat' and stir the energy up through dancing and they channel 
		it for their shamanic healing rituals.</span></span></p>
		<p class="auto-style13">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="auto-style13">
		In Africa, the 
		drum has a spiritual significance as well. It aids in ritual and 
		dancing.&nbsp;Dance and music along with the rhythm of the drum are 
		inseparable expressions. The beating of the drums facilitate awareness 
		and helps to induce trance. As the vibrations of the drums permeate the 
		body, altered states are achieved. The music and dance work to entrain 
		the body and entrance the mind into a personalized and vibrationally 
		conscious state.</p>
		<p class="auto-style13">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="auto-style11"><span class="auto-style12">R</span><span style="line-height: 1.22em; word-spacing: normal;" class="auto-style12">esearch 
		has even demonstrated that energetic rhythms cause the brain to 
		synchronize and helps to balance the cerebral hemispheres. This makes 
		much sense in that the africans used this energy to also mimic 
		primordial energy and go along in tapping into their own divine 
		energies. One Vodun practitioner calls the drum playing as 'beating the 
		spirits into the head'.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style13">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="auto-style5">
		<span style="line-height: 1.22em; word-spacing: normal;">
		<span class="auto-style12">In my 
		experience in african dance, namely the Yanvalou, It keeps my spine 
		supple and flexible and my body worked out. I like to practice this 
		before my meditations. It is a specific dance with which I equate with a 
		different form of kundalini yoga. I also find that I get an energy buzz 
		after the dancing and so it is an enjoyable way for me to begin my other 
		practices. I love african dancing as it is very fun, freeing and groovy!</span><br clear="none" style="line-height: 1.22em;" class="auto-style12" />
