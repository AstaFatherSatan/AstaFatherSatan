		Who Brought The&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		Slaves To America?<br clear="none" />
		By Walter White Jr., 19684-12-8<br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		The story of the slaves in America begins with Christopher Columbus. His 
		voyage to America was not financed by Queen Isabella, but by Luis de 
		Santangelo, who advanced the sum of 17,000 ducats (about 5,000 
		pounds-today equal to 50,000 pounds) to finance the voyage, which began 
		on August 3, 1492.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		Columbus was accompanied by five 'maranos' (Jews who had foresworn their 
		religion and supposedly became Catholics), Luis de Torres, interpreter, 
		Marco, the surgeon, Bemal, the physician, Alonzo de la Calle and Gabriel 
		Sanchez (1).&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		Gabriel Sanchez, abetted by the other four Jews, sold Columbus on the 
		idea of capturing 500 Indians and selling them as slaves in Seville, 
		Spain, which was done. Columbus did not receive any of the money from 
		the sale of the slaves, but he became the victim of a conspiracy 
		fostered by Bemal, the ship's doctor. He, Columbus, suffered injustice 
		and imprisonment as his reward. Betrayed by the five maranos (Jews) whom 
		he had trusted and helped. This, ironically, was the beginning of 
		slavery in the Americas (2).&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		The Jews were expelled from Spain on August 2, 1492, and from Portugal 
		in 1497. Many of these Jews emigrated to Holland, where they set up the 
		Dutch West Indies Company to exploit the new world.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		In 1654, the first Jew, Jacob Barsimson, emigrated from Holland to New 
		Amsterdam (New York) and in the next decade many more followed him, 
		settling along the East Coast, principally in New Amsterdam and Newport, 
		Rhode Island. They were prevented by ordinances issued by Governor Peter 
		Stuyvesant from engaging in the domestic economy, so they quickly 
		discovered that the territory inhabited by the Indians would be a 
		fertile field. There were no laws preventing the Jews from trading with 
		the Indians.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		The first Jew to begin trading with the Indians was Hayman Levy, who 
		imported cheap glass beads, textiles, earrings, armbands and other cheap 
		adornments from Holland which were traded for valuable fur pelts. Hayman 
		Levy was soon joined by Jews Nicholas Lowe and Joseph Simon. Lowe 
		conceived the idea of trading rum and whiskey to the Indians and set up 
		a distillery in Newport, where these two liquors were produced. Within a 
		short time there were 22 distilleries in Newport, all of them owned by 
		Jews, manufacturing and distributing 'firewater.' The story of the 
		debauching of the Indians with its resultant massacres of the early 
		settlers, is a dramatic story in itself.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		It is essential to comprehend the seaport of Newport. It is important in 
		order to recognize the Jewish share in the Slave commerce. There was a 
		period when it was commonly referred to as 'The Jewish Newport- World 
		center of Slave Commerce.' All together, at this time, there were in 
		North America six Jewish communities: Newport, Charleston, New York, 
		Philadelphia, Richmond, and Savanuah. There were also many other Jews, 
		scattered over the entire East Coast. Although New York held first place 
		in the settlers of Jews in North America, Newport held second place.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		New York was also the main source of Kosher meat, supplying the North 
		American settlements, then the West Indies and also South America. Now 
		Newport took over! Newport also became the great trade harbour of the 
		East Coast of North America. There, vessels from other ports met, to 
		exchange commodities.. Newport, as previously mentioned, represented the 
		foremost place in the commerce of rum, whiskey, and liquor dealings. And 
		to conclude, it finally became the Main Center of Slave dealings. It was 
		from this port that the ships left on their way across the ocean, to 
		gather their black human cargo and then derive great sums of money in 
		exchange for them.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		An authentic, contemporary report, based on authority, indicates that of 
		128 Slave ships, for instance, unloaded in Charleston, within one year, 
		their "Cargo," 120 of these were undersigned by Jews from Newport and 
		Charleston by their own name. About the rest of them, one can surmise, 
		although they were entered as Boston (1), Norfolk (2), and Baltimore 
		(4), their real owners were similarly the Jewish slave dealers from 
		Newport and Charleston.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		One is able to assess the Jewish share in the entire dealings of the 
		Newport, if one considers the undertaking of a lone Jew, the Portuguese, 
		Aaron Lopez, who plays an important part in the over-all story of the 
		Jews and Slavery.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		Concerning the entire commerce of the Colonies, and the later State of 
		Rhode Island, (which included Newport) bills of lading, concessions, 
		receipts, and port clearances carried the signature name of the Jew 
		Aaron Lopez (3). This all took place during the years 1726 to 1774. He 
		had therefore more than 50% of all dealings under his personal control 
		for almost fifty years. Aside from that there were other ships which he 
		owned, but sailed under other names.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		In the year 1749, the first Masonic Lodge was established. Ninety 
		percent of the members of this first lodge, fourteen all told, were 
		Jews. And one knows that only so-called "prominent" individuals were 
		accepted. Twenty years later, the second Masonic Lodge, "King David," 
		was established. It is a fact that all of these members were Jews.<br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		In the meantime, the Jewish influence in Newport had reached such 
		proportions that President George Washington decided to pay them a 
		visit. Upon his appearance, both of the Masonic Lodges sent an emissary- 
		a Jew named Moses Seixas (4) -to approach the President with a petition, 
		in which the Jews of Newport stated: "If you will permit the children of 
		Abraham to approach you with a request, to tell you that we honor you, 
		and feel an alliance....... and then: "Until the present time the 
		valuable rights of a free citizen have been withheld. However, now we 
		see a new government coming into being based on the Majesty of the 
		people, a government, not sanctioning any bigotry nor persecution of the 
		Jew, rather, to concede the freedom of thought, which each shares, 
		whatever Nation or Language, as a part of the great Government 
		machine."&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		It is necessary at this point to consider the disclosures as to who in 
		reality obtained this legendary freedom in America at the founding of 
		the Union.. To be sure, the province became independent and severed from 
		the English Jurisdiction. <br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		However, we can see from the petition (5) which Moses Seixas offered 
		President Washington in the name of the Jews of Newport, that it was not 
		in reality this type of freedom which they had in mind. They were merely 
		concerned about themselves, and their "own civil rights," which had been 
		withheld. Therefore, following the Revolutionary War, the Jews were 
		accorded equal rights, and freed of all restrictions! And the Negroes? 
		The Revolutionary War not withstanding, they remained Slaves! In the 
		year 1750, one sixth of the population in New York was Negroid, and 
		proportionately in the Southern parts of the Country, they outnumbered 
		the others, but the proclamation of Freedom did not touch them. More of 
		this later.<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		Let us scrutinize at close range this dismal handwork of the Jews which 
		gave them influence and power, so we may comprehend the Slave Trade; for 
		there has been so much written since that time by the zealous Jewish 
		writers, that at the present, long since removed, it might appear 
		natural, for the time element has a tendency to make things 
		nebulous.&nbsp;Let us follow the journey of one ship, owned by a slave 
		dealer, Aaron Lopez, which had made many trips to the African coast.&nbsp;For 
		instance, in the month of May, 1752, the ship "Abigail" was equipped 
		with about 9,000 gallons of rum, a great supply of iron foot and hand 
		restraints, pistols, powder, sabres, and a lot of worthless tin 
		ornaments, and under the command of the Jewish Captain Freedman, sailed 
		off for Africa.<br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		There were but two Mates and six sailors comprising the crew. Three and 
		one half months later they landed on the African Coast. Meantime, there 
		had been constructed an African Agency, by the Jewish slave dealers, who 
		had corralled them, and prepared them for sale. This organization 
		reaching deep into Africa, had many ramifications, including the heads 
		of groups, villages, etc. <br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		This method to win over these leaders for the Jewish slave trade, was 
		similar to' that which the Jews had employed with the Indians.<br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		At first, they presented them with rum, and soon found themselves in an 
		alcoholic delirium. When the gold dust, and ivory supply was exhausted, 
		they were induced to sell their descendants. At first their wives, and 
		then their youths. Then they began warfare among each other, plotted and 
		developed mostly by the Jews, and if they captured prisoners, these, 
		too, were exchanged for rum, ammunitions and weapons to the Jews, using 
		them for further campaigns to capture more Negroes. The captured Blacks 
		were linked two by two and driven through the medieval forests to the 
		coast.&nbsp;These painful treks required weeks, and some of them frequently 
		became ill, and felled by exhaustion, and many unable to rise even 
		though the bull whip was applied as an encourager. They were left to die 
		and were devoured by wild beasts. It was not unusual to see the bones of 
		the dead laying in the tropical sun, a sad and gruesome reminder to 
		those who would later on tread this path.&nbsp;It has been calculated that 
		for each Negro who withstood the rigors of this wandering, there still 
		had to be the long voyage across the ocean, before they reached American 
		soil, nine out of ten died! And when one considers that there was a 
		yearly exodus of ONE MILLION black slaves, then, and only then, can one 
		assess the tremendous and extensive exodus of the African people. <br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		At present Africa is thinly populated, not alone due to the 1,000,000 
		literally dragged out of huts, but due to the five to nine million who 
		never reached their destination. Once they reached the coast, the black 
		slaves were driven together, and restraints were applied to hold them 
		until the next transport ship docked. The agents-many of them Jews- who 
		represented the Chief, then began the deal with the Captain. Each Negro 
		was personally presented to him. But the captains had learned to become 
		suspicious. The Black one must move his fingers, arms, legs, and the 
		entire body to insure that there were not any fractures. Even the teeth 
		were examined. If a tooth was lacking, it lowered the price. Most of the 
		Jew agents knew how to treat sick Negroes with chemicals in order to 
		sell them as sound. Each Negro was valued at about 100 gallons of rum, 
		100 pounds of gun powder, or in cash between 18 to 20 dollars. <br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		The notations of a captain inform us that on September 5, 1763, one 
		Negro brought as much as 200 gallons of rum, due to the bidding among 
		the agents, raising the price.&nbsp;Women under 25 years, pregnant or not, 
		resulted in the same measure, if they were well and comely. Any over 25 
		years lost 25%.&nbsp;And here it should be stated that those Negroes, 
		purchased free at the African Coast for 20 to 40 dollars, were then 
		resold by the same slave dealers in America for two thousand 
		dollars.&nbsp;This gives one an idea how the Jews managed to acquire 
		tremendous fortunes. Following the bargaining, Captain Freedman paid the 
		bill, either in merchandise or cash. He also recalled some advice which 
		his Jewish employers gave him as he left Newport for Africa: "Pour as 
		much water into the rum as you possibly can." In this manner the Negro 
		chiefs were cheated two times by the Newport Jews!&nbsp;The next step was to 
		shave the hair from the head of the acquired slaves. Then they were 
		bound and branded with a hot iron, either on the back, or the hip, 
		identifying them with their owners. <br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		Now the Negro slave was indeed the property of the Jewish purchaser. If 
		he fled he could be identified. Following this procedure, there was a 
		farewell celebration. There were instances when entire families were 
		brought out of the interior, to the coast, and then separated through 
		the buyer- the father going with one ship, the sons and daughters into 
		another. These "farewell" celebrations were usually packed with emotion, 
		tears, drama and sadness. There was little joy, if ever.&nbsp;The following 
		day the transport began from land to ship. It was managed by taking four 
		to six Negroes at one time in rowboats to the ship. Of course the slave 
		dealers were aware of how the Negro loved his homeland above all else, 
		and could only be induced by great force to leave it. <br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		So, some of the Negroes would leap into the water. But here the 
		overseers were prepared with sharp dogs and retrieved the fleeing men. 
		Other Negroes preferred drowning. What came aboard alive was immediately 
		undressed. Here was another opportunity to jump overboard and reach land 
		and freedom. But the slave dealers were pitiless and ruthless; they were 
		merely concerned to get their Black cargo to America with the least 
		loss. Therefore, an escapee, recaptured, had both of his legs cut off 
		before the eyes of the remaining Negroes in order to restore "Order."&nbsp;On 
		board the ship the Negroes were separated into three groups. The men 
		were placed in one part of the ship. The women into another, whereby the 
		lusty Captain arranged it so that the youngest, mostly comely Negro 
		women were accessible to him.<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		The children remained on deck, covered with a cloth in bad weather. In 
		this fashion the slave ship proceeded on its journey to America. In the 
		main, the ships were too small, and not at all suitable to transport 
		people. They were barely equipped to transport animals, which the 
		Negroes were likened to. In one space, one meter high (39 inches) these 
		unfortunate creatures were placed into a horizontal position, pressed 
		close together. Mostly they were chained together. In this position they 
		had to remain for three months, until the end of the voyage. Rarely was 
		there a captain who sympathized with them or evidenced any feelings 
		whatever for these pitiable creatures. Occasionally they would be taken 
		in groups to the deck for fresh air, shackled in irons.&nbsp;Somehow, these 
		Negroes were expendable and endured much. On occasion, one of them 
		became insane, killing the other one pressed closely to him. They also 
		had their fingernails closely cut so they could not tear at each other's 
		flesh. The most horrible battles came about among the men, to acquire a 
		centimeter or two for a comfortable position. It was then that the slave 
		overseer stepped in with his bullwhip. The unimaginable, horrible, human 
		excrement in which these slaves had to endure these trips is impossible 
		to describe.<br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		In the women's quarters the same conditions prevailed. Women gave birth 
		to children lying pressed closely together. The younger Negro women were 
		constantly raped by the captain and the crew resulting, thereby, a new 
		type of Mulatto as they came to America.<br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		In Virginia, or in any of the other Southern port cities, the slaves 
		were transferred to the land and immediately sold. A regular auction 
		would take place, following the method of purchase in Africa. The 
		highest bidder obtained the "Ware." In many cases- due to the 
		indescribable filth- some of the Blacks became ill during the sea voyage 
		from Africa to America. They became unemployable. In such cases the 
		captain accepted any price. It was rare to dispose of them for no one 
		wanted to purchase a sick Negro. Therefore, it is not surprising that 
		the Jewish, unethical doctor senses a new form of revenue. They 
		purchased the sick Negro for a small sum, then treated him, and sold him 
		for a large sum. On occasion, the captain would be left with a few 
		Negroes for whom he did not find a buyer. In that case he returned to 
		Newport and sold them to the Jews for cheap domestic help. In other 
		cases, the Jew owner of the ships took them over. This is why the city 
		of Newport and its surroundings had 4,697 black slaves in the year 
		1756.&nbsp;Slavery did not extend to the North.<br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		Moreover, in many of the North American Colonies, slavery was strictly 
		forbidden. Georgia came under discussion; likewise also Philadelphia. 
		And again it was the Jews who managed a loophole, which had given them 
		freedom following the Revolutionary War, so, they schemed to make slave 
		trading legal. One had but to read the names of those persons living in 
		Philadelphia who were requesting the elimination of existing laws 
		regarding the slavery dealing. <br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		They were: the Jews Sandiford, Lay, Woolman, Solomon, and Benezet. That 
		explained it all! But let us turn back to the slave ship "Abigail." Its 
		captain- and we are reading from his ship's books- did a profitable 
		business. He sold all of his Negroes in Virginia, invested some of the 
		money in tobacco, rice, sugar, and cotton, and went on to Newport where 
		he deposited his wares.<br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		We learn from Captain Freedman's books that the "Abigail" was a small 
		ship and could only accommodate 56 people. He managed, however, to clear 
		from one trip 6,621 dollars, which he in turn delivered to the owner of 
		the ship: one Aaron Lopez.&nbsp;The staggering amounts of money acquired by 
		the Jew ship owners and slavery dealers is better illustrated when we 
		emphasize the many years in which this sale and purchase of human flesh 
		was practiced. <br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		Prior to 1661, all of the Colonies had laws prohibiting slavery. It was 
		in that year that the Jews had become powerful enough to bring about the 
		repeal of these laws, and slavery began in earnest.&nbsp;The Jews had 
		discovered that the Colonists needed additional manpower to help them 
		clear their fields for planting, helping in the construction of 
		dwellings, and in general to help with harvesting their crops. This was 
		particularly true of the Southern states which we have referred to 
		earlier. The Southerners had vast tracts of rich soil suitable for rice, 
		cotton, tobacco and cane sugar. <br />
		<br />
		<br />
		At first, impoverished Europeans were recruited. English prison doors 
		were opened and finally prisoners of war from England and Holland were 
		brought to the Colonies, made to work until they had paid the cost of 
		transporting them by ship and then set free.&nbsp;It doesn't take a Jew long 
		to discover what his brothers are doing, so a group of Jews settled in 
		Charleston, South Carolina, where they set up distilleries for making 
		rum and whiskey. They, too, learned that they could trade with the 
		natives on the West Coast of Africa for ivory, and several ships were 
		purchased and sent to Africa, trading the usual glass beads and other 
		cheap ornaments for ivory, which, however, took up but little space on 
		board ship. It occurred to these Jew traders that they could supply the 
		plantations in the South with "Black Ivory," needed under swampy and 
		malarial conditions which European labor could not tolerate without 
		sickness, and which would not only fill the holds of their ships, but 
		bring enormous profits. (This same group had earlier tried selling 
		Indians as slaves but they found them completely unsatisfactory, as the 
		Indians would not tolerate this type of work.) <br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		Thus, another segment of the slave trading had become active and 
		profitable out of Charleston, South Carolina. Several shiploads of Black 
		slaves were sent by the Dutch West Indies Company to Manhattan.&nbsp;During 
		this time there were a number of plantation owners established in the 
		West Indies and two Jews, Eyrger and Sayuer, with strong Rothschild 
		connections in Spain, formed an agency called ASIENTO, which later 
		operated in Holland and England...<br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		It was through these connections that Jews in Holland and England 
		exerted influence and both of these connections cooperated in helping 
		the Jews provide Black Slaves for the Colonists. With the yearly capture 
		and transport of one million Black slaves it is not difficult to figure 
		that from 1661 to 1774 (one hundred thirteen years) approximately one 
		hundred ten million slaves had been removed from their native land. 
		About ten percent, or ELEVEN MILLION, Black slaves reached the Colonies 
		alive.&nbsp;We have talked about the small ship "Abigail" which could 
		accommodate only 56 people and yet the profits per trip were enormous, 
		with little or no investment. There were many other ships but we will 
		concentrate here on only a few, such as the "La Fortuna," "Hannah," 
		"Sally" or the "Venue" which made very great profits. The "La Fortuna," 
		by the way, transported approximately 217 slaves on each trip. The owner 
		cleared not less than $41,438.00 from such a trip. These were dollars 
		which the slave dealers "could keep."<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		And these were dollars of value which would buy a great deal in 
		return.&nbsp;When one considers that the Jews of Newport owned about 300 
		slave- transporting ships, active without interruption, docking at 
		Newport- Africa, Charleston, (or Virginia), one can approximate the 
		tremendous earnings which made their way to Jewish ship owners. Indeed, 
		the Jews admit, that of the 600 ships, leaving Newport harbor into all 
		the world, "at least half of them" went their way to Africa, and we know 
		what these ships going to Africa "were seeking."&nbsp;The fact that Aaron 
		Lopez had control of over more than half of the combined deals in the 
		Colonies of Rhode Island, with Newport, is well-known.<br />
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		The well-known Rabbi Morris A. Gutstein, in his book, The Story of the 
		Jews in Newport, attempts to remove these facts, maintaining that there 
		is not any evidence that the Jews were connected with the Slave Trade. 
		It is therefore imperative to prove that the Jew was indeed connected 
		with the slave trading. Especially so since this rabbi insists they had 
		made great contributions, and how very "blessed" their residence became 
		for the city of Newport. Surely Morris A. Gutstein will grant us 
		permission to present the facts which he was unable to find.&nbsp;<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		Turning to one report of the Chamber of Commerce of the "Rhode Island 
		Colony" in the year 1764, we find, for instance, that in the year 1723 
		"a few merchants in Newport" devised the idea to send their Newport rum 
		to the coast of Africa. It developed into such a great export that in 
		the matter of a few years "several thousand (hogsheads)" of rum went 
		that way. To which purpose did this rum serve?&nbsp;The Carnegie Institute in 
		Washington D.C., presents and makes public authentic documents entitled 
		"Documents Illustrative of the History of the Slave Trade in America". 
		We wish to present a few facts from this particular collection of 
		original documents and scrutinize them at closer range, and not at all 
		to prove the heretofore Rabbi Morris A. Gutstein in error.
		<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		In this collection of the first American institute of learning, we 
		evaluate the capital "Rhode Island" which contributed the main share of 
		the public documentation regarding the Slave trading. Here we find 
		documented the recipients of the numerous shipping letters, also letters 
		to the Slave dealers, and correspondence to the ship's captains, who 
		were about 15% Jews, living in Newport. Among these we find, for 
		instance, the Jew Isaac Elizar. He wrote a letter to Captain Christopher 
		Champlin on February 6, 1763, saying he would like to be an agent for a 
		load of slaves. Then follows the Jew Abraham Pereira Mendez, and one of 
		the main slave dealers, Jacob Rod Rivera- the father-in-law of Aaron 
		Lopez. And then there is Aaron Lopez, himself, and many, many more other 
		Jews. <br />
		<br />
		<br />
		Although we have considered Aaron Lopez several times, the size of this 
		documented treatise limits us, and we cannot describe all of the writers 
		concerned in the Slavery Dealing correspondence, their names and the 
		special dates-rather, we wish to study the documentation of the 
		"Carnegie Institute" itself, keeping Aaron Lopez in mind. We wish to see 
		what in the main this Jew was pursuing and what his business was. This 
		is due to the fact that Rabbi Morris A. Gutstein presents him as a 
		"lofty and fine civilian of Newport" who was so generous and even "made 
		contributions to welfare."&nbsp;&nbsp;In a great number of published original 
		unprejudiced writings in the Carnegie Institute, we find that Aaron 
		Lopez pursued a tremendous commerce in rum with the African coast in 
		exchange for slaves. <br clear="none" />

		<br clear="none" />

		Aside from that, there are similar statements out of letters by Aaron 
		Lopez in the original, which he directed to the Captains Henry Cruger, 
		David Mill, Henry White, Thomas Dolbeare, and William Moore. Indeed, one 
		letter by Captain William Moore to Aaron Lopez &amp; Company, is 
		particularly revealing, and of special mention at this point. We wish to 
		remark on the main contents of this letter in which Captain Moore 
		writes: "I wish to advise you that your ship 'Ann' docked here night 
		before last with 112 slaves, consisting of 35 men, 16 large youths, 21 
		small boys, 29 women, 2 grown girls, 9 small girls, and I assure you 
		this is such a one rum cargo (rum in exchange for slaves) which I have 
		not yet encountered, among the entire group there may be five to which 
		one could take exception."&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		The date of the above letter was November 27, 1773. We have not yet 
		concluded, because of lack of space, the excerpts and grateful 
		compilations made available by the "Carnegie Institute."&nbsp;On November 29, 
		1767, the Jew Abraham Pereira Mendez, who had been cheated by one of his 
		kind, from Charleston, where he had journeyed to better control his 
		Black cargo, wrote Aaron Lopez at Newport:&nbsp;"These Negroes, which Captain 
		Abraham All delivered to me, were in such poor condition due to the poor 
		transportation, that I was forced to sell 8 boys and girls for a mere 27 
		(pounds), 2 other for 45 (pounds) and two women each for 35 (pounds)." 
		(No doubt, English money)&nbsp;Abraham Pereia Mendez was very angry and 
		accused Aaron Lopez of "cheating" him. This letter delineates to us that 
		this generous and fine citizen of Newport was insatiable in his greed 
		for money. This is what caused the Rabbi Morris A. Gutstein to present 
		this nobleman, Aaron Lopez, to pursue his objectionable methods. Negroes 
		presented to him but a commodity.&nbsp;<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		In all of the letters which the "Carnegie Institute" published, it 
		stresses the lack of human sympathy for the poor Negro slaves. This lack 
		of feeling and compassion for the abused and pitiful Blacks at the hands 
		of their Jewish dealers, can be read out of the diary of a captain who 
		manned a ship owned by Aaron Lopez. The entrees concern a trip from the 
		African Coast to Charleston. Moreover, they are authentic documents, 
		published by the "Camegie Institute" in Washington D.C., calling 
		attention to an organization which had heretofore known little or 
		nothing about; neither had they encountered further publicity in books 
		or newspapers.<br />

		Therefore, it is not to be wondered at that the facts of the leading 
		share of American Jews in the slave trade could be pointed out as a 
		monopoly, and unknown to the non-Jewish Americans, including the great 
		masses of people all over the world. Others, however, acquainted with 
		the facts, had good reason to remain painfully quiet.&nbsp;The captain of 
		another ship, the "Othello" among other things, makes the following 
		entries in his diary:&nbsp;February 6th: One man drowned in the process of 
		loading.<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		March 18th: Two women went overboard because they had not been locked 
		up.<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		April 6th: One man dead with Flux. (No doubt an illness.)<br clear="none" />
		April 13th: One woman dead with Flux.<br clear="none" />
		May 7th: One man dead with Flux.June 16th: One man dead by Kap Henry.<br clear="none" />
		June 21st: One man dead by James Fluss.<br clear="none" />
		July 5th: One woman dead with fever.<br clear="none" />
		July 6th: One girl, sick for two months, died.<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		This vessel was on its way for five months. What terrible and 
		unspeakable suffering was the lot of these millions of Blacks, who were 
		torn with brutal force from their friendly African huts, jammed 
		together, like animals below deck, and then sold with less concern than 
		selling a head of cattle. Small wonder that ten of them died, being 
		purchased for just a few dollars, and then sold for the sum of 
		$2,000.00.&nbsp;Some Negroes managed, through insurrection, to gain control 
		of one or another ship and turned it around, with full sails, toward 
		their African home. <br />
		<br />
		<br />
		The crew of one slave ship, "Three Friends" for instance, tortured their 
		Black cargo in such a manner that the Negroes reciprocated in a bloody 
		rebellion. They killed the captain and the entire crew and threw the 
		dead overboard. They then sailed back to Africa where they had barely 
		escaped their hard wElopeson freedom.&nbsp;A similar fate struck the slave 
		ship "Amistad". Among the slaves was the son of an enemy tribal chief. 
		Once the ship was under way, he schemed with his compatriots to attack 
		the ship's crew. Following a bloody battle, they managed to capture the 
		captain. The Negro prince forced him to turn back to Africa, then in the 
		evening, under cover of darkness, he changed his course, zigzagged for 
		months until he came close to the American coast, and encountered a 
		government ship. This took place in the year 1839 when slave trading was 
		already forbidden and illegal.&nbsp;The Negro slaves were freed and the 
		captain punished. These sea voyages were not without danger when they 
		had Black cargo, which accounts for the fact that the Jews most always 
		engaged non-Jewish captains.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />

		<br />
		The slave dealers preferred to remain in their offices and counted the 
		fat winnings following each journey, such as Aaron Lopez, who left his 
		heirs one of the largest fortunes in the New England era.&nbsp;When reviewing 
		the documented facts contained herein, it is important that one always 
		remembers that it was a lucky captain who did not lose more than 9 out 
		of 19 slaves on the return trip.&nbsp;It is equally important to remember 
		that these poor Black creatures had to lie in human excrement for the 
		entire trip. Think of it! No wonder sickness and disease took such a 
		high toll. Remember the figures: approximately one hundred ten million 
		Black people were captured and removed from their homeland in Africa. 
		Only ELEVEN MILLION of these Black slaves reached the Colonies 
		alive.&nbsp;And the Jews still talk about the Germans and Hitler and how six 
		million Jews were exterminated during World War II. This is the greatest 
		LIE ever perpetrated upon the people of the world, whereas the story of 
		the poor Black slaves is documented. Documented with TRUTH.

		The evidence is still available for the people of the world to see.&nbsp;The 
		"Carnegie Institute of Technology" is located in Pittsburgh, 
		Pennsylvania.&nbsp;As this document is distributed, eventually reaching the 
		hands of the Jew, the evidence will probably be removed and destroyed 
		until finally all documentation is removed which is damaging to the Jew. 
		The Jews have been engaged in this practice for centuries. Truth, 
		however, truth which bears fact cannot remain covered or hidden forever. 
		and more truths are being disclosed by those of us who intend to free 
		America of these sons of evil- the Jews.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />

		Carnegie Institute of Learning, presently known as "The Carnegie 
		Institute of Technology."&nbsp;The following is a partial of the slave ships

		Slave-runners, also owned by Jews were the 'La Fortuna', the 'Hannah', 
		the 'Sally', and the 'Venue'.&nbsp;Some of the Jews of Newport and Charleston 
		who were engaged in the distillery or slavery trade, or both, were: 
		Isaac Gomez, Hayman Levy, Jacob Malhado, Naphtaly Myers, David Hart, 
		Joseph Jacobs, Moses Ben Franks, Moses Gomez, Isaac Dias, Benjamin Levy, 
		David Jeshuvum, Jacob Pinto, Jacob Turk, Daniel Gomez, James Lucana, Jan 
		de Sweevts, Felix (cha-cha) de Souza (known as the 'Prince of Slavers' 
		and second only to Aaron Lopez), Simeon Potter, Isaac Elizer, Jacob Rod, 
		Jacol) Itodrigues Rivera, Haym Isaac Carregal, Abraham Touro, Moses 
		Hays, Moses Lopez, Judah Touro, Abrtham Mendes and Abraham All.&nbsp;<br clear="none" />
		<br clear="none" />
		Of some 600 ships leaving the port of Newport, more than 300 were 
		engaged in the slave trade. A typical cargo of one ship, 'La Fortuna', 
		was 217 slaves which cost about $4,300 and sold for $41,438.00.&nbsp;Only 
		about 10% of the slave ship captains were Jews, not wanting to subject 
		themselves to the rigors of the 6-month journey. They preferred to stay 
		at home and continue their distillery operations which continued to 
		supply rum and whiskey to the Indians for many years at a very great 
		profit.&nbsp;<br />
