			<div>
				Ever since Satan created humanity and set to give humans the 
				gift of the gods (spiritual power and immortality), there have 
				been massive attacks and infiltration on our sacred existence 
				and on this Earth to stop this.</div>
			<div>
				<br />
			</div>
			<div>
				Satan and the gods created humanity to be extensions of their 
				divine and extraterrestrial family but the enemy gods did not 
				want this for us. They wanted to enslave and use us as cattle, 
				just as they are doing today with this system, Christianity, 
				Islam, etc. Humans have a powerful energy source (the soul and 
				life force.) Souls are a source of energy.</div>
			<div>
				<br />
			</div>
			<div>
				<br />
				With more and more information being found and coming to 
				surface, it is very clear and obvious that Satan is the creator 
				of humanity, and our Daemon gods are the gods that taught and 
				guided humanity. The enemy has tricked us into believing in that 
				disgusting false God, Jehovah, YHVH, Allah, etc. These are all 
				names of a group of evil beings who are pretending to be our 
				creators.<br />
			</div>
			<div>
				<br />
				Everything is Backwards. The one called Satan is the true god of 
				humanity. He was labeled as evil to keep us away from him.<br />
				<br />
			</div>
			<div>
				<br />
				This enemy attack and infiltration has been going on since the 
				beginning to all cultures but I will focus on how this relates 
				to the Black race in Africa.&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				<br />
				<br />
				On the subject of blood sacrifice, in Africa tribes have been 
				sacrificing other&nbsp; tribes and animals for rituals to satisfy 
				their "gods" and for favors. This blood sacrifice is to supply 
				energy and the power of the life force to the enemy gods. I 
				already mentioned that the life force and soul energy of humans 
				and living things can be used. The Enemy gods have tricked 
				Blacks in Africa to give them blood sacrifices for centuries. 
				This is seen today in Voodoo, for example. Blood sacrifice is 
				also BIG in Christianity. Just read the Bible and you will see 
				what I mean.</div>
			<div>
				<br />
			</div>
			<div>
				<br />
				If you study the ancient Mayans and Aztecs. you will see that 
				they had the same problem. Their culture was attacked&nbsp; by the 
				enemy reptilian gods that also tricked them into taking blood 
				sacrifices. This has been documented in history as these tribes 
				were known to perform human sacrifice. In addition, if you study 
				these tribes, you will see that they always painted, drew and or 
				described these gods as Reptilian looking. Scales on the skin, 
				lizard like eyes, etc. An African Zulu Elder depicted the gods 
				that he sees as Reptilian in nature.<br />
				<br />
				All one has to do is look up something like<a href="../google.com/search_q=zulu+reptilian+beings_client=firefox-b-1-d_source=lnms_tbm=isch_sa=X_ved=0ah.html"><span class="auto-style3"> 
				"Zulu Reptilian" </span></a>&nbsp;in an internet search engine 
				and you can see how Reptilians have been involved in Africa. Our 
				gods are not reptilians. Where ever Reptilians go, ritual blood 
				sacrifice happens.<br />
			</div>
			<div>
				<br />
				<br />
				All of this violence and negativity is NOT of Satan. Satan and 
				the Daemon gods do not demand or want blood sacrifices nor do 
				they want us to be slaves.
				The enemy could not destroy and take all spiritual power so they 
				got in and infiltrated instead.</div>
			<div>
			</div>
			<div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<br />
				<br />
				When one comes to Satan and Spiritual Satanism today, many doors 
				open and we are then exposed to their positive energies. All of 
				us. However, as one begins their journey into Satanism, you will 
				come to see that the enemy is still working to keep us away from 
				Satan and the truth. Getting negative thoughts concerning Satan 
				and the Gods, fear, psychic attacks and feeling depressed are 
				among the things that has happened to us. This is all of the 
				enemy. Even "Angelic beings" start to attack you...which shows 
				that they do not want us coming to the truth. This is the real 
				deal and you will see that as you progress.<br />
				<br />
			</div>
			<div>
				<br />
			</div>
			<div>
				Despite all of the attempted attacks by the Enemy to keep us way 
				from Satan, we will always be protected by him and you end up 
				stronger than before. I remember the first enemy attack I 
				experienced- it was very surreal but I am now to the level where 
				enemy attacks no longer phase me. They do not work anymore.</div>
			<div>
				<br />

				I am at the point where nothing or no one will ever convince me 
				that spiritual Satanism is not the true path. Spiritual Satanism 
				is life changing and something you prove to yourself.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
