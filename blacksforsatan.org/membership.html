	Spiritual Satanism is a life loving religious path. In following Spiritual 
	Satanism/commiting to Satan, we are bringing back to life Humanity's 
	original religious practice.
	<a href="black_spirituality.html">
	<span class="auto-style3">Our Black ancestors practiced Spiritual Satanism</span></a></p>

		<p>
		The journey in Spiritual Satanism is very life changing. While under the guidance of Satan and his Daemons, they look out for and 
		protect us (physically and spiritually) from harm, teach us and help us evolve 
		and grow. Ever since I came across 
		Spiritual Satanism, my life has changed greatly, and I continue to 
		advance and empower myself- its only getting better.&nbsp; I have also 
		had many positive spiritual experiences. I have gained more confidence 
		and self love along with appreciation of life and the importance of my 
		soul. Life is always better with Satan. </p>
		<p>
		<span class="auto-style9">It is important to know that when we are 
		dedicated and open ourselves up to Satan and the Gods, we get exposed to 
		their energy frequency- this opens ourselves to positive energy</span>.</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="auto-style5">
		When one decides to follow this path, dedicating yourself to Satan is 
		the next step.</p>

		<span class="auto-style7">In Spiritual Satanism, we are expected to
