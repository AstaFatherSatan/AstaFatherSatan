		<p dir="ltr"><span class="auto-style6">Witchcraft and energy work has 
		always been apart of Black ancient paganism before Christianity and 
		Islam. </p>
		<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</span><span class="auto-style9"><span class="auto-style8">As 
		we all know every race has a history of paganism/satanism. In satanism 
		there is witchcraft and the knowledge on how to use it. Unfortunately 
		due to Christianity&nbsp; and Islam it's been attacked. For example in 
		Sukuma, the Kongo and Yoruba, witchcraft was very strong.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style8" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
		</span>
		<p class="auto-style11" dir="ltr">In Sukuma "Bulogi" means witchery. 
		Those who practice Bulogi are called Balogi or witches. Witchcraft isn't 
		just among the bulogi but also 'batemi' cheifs and 'bufumu' healers. It 
		is said Balogi can make themselves invisible and transform themselves 
		into animals. Similar to how the Egyptian Pharoah had multiple Kah's 
		because of being close to the gods and being very spiritually advanced. 
		It isn't physical it's spiritual. Balogi, like satanic covens, meet each 
		other in nocturnal covens. In places where they are alone they get naked 
		and sing and dance. Just like certain covens danced around a bonfire&nbsp; 
		and played instruments to raise energy.</p>
		<span class="auto-style9">
		<p class="auto-style8" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</span><span class="auto-style6">In 
		the Kongo witchery was prevalent. Witchcraft there is called Kindoki. 
		Just like how we can perform white magic and black magic. The kindoki 
		can be used for positive and negative purposes. There are chiefs and 
		healers called banganga and witches/sorcerers called bandoki who use 
		kindoki. Bandoki have night knowledge or 4 eyes just like astral sight. 
		They can move around in the spiritual world. It is said Bandoki can 
		transform themselves into animals, leave their bodies and fly away. This 
		is

		<p class="auto-style8" dir="ltr">In Yoruba witch is 'aje' and a sorcerer 
		is called 'oso'. I note that is 'aje' is also similar to 'ashe' which is 
		also an african word that means life force or power. </p>
		<p class="auto-style8" dir="ltr">&nbsp;Belief in witchery is almost universal 
		in Yoruba. They call black magic 'epe'. Witches obtain their spiritual 
		power from Orishas (chakras ). They also have covens called 'ajo' mainly 
		composed of elder women in league with each other. Sorcery called 'osho 
		can be used for good or bad. A sorcerer may be called 'oloogun'.</p>
		</span><span class="auto-style9">
		<p class="auto-style8" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style11" dir="ltr">Christian missionaries and Islamic 
		invaders were highly critical of Yoruba heathenism. They weakened the 
		adherence to indigenous African religions. Xian and Muslim leaders 
		sometimes fought against indigenous African beliefs and practices. To a 
		certain degree pagan African religions managed to survive in altered 
		forms. Among the Kongo pagans have been combating against Xianity for 
		more than 500 years.&nbsp; It has been a never ending ar with the 
		enemy...</p>

		history.</span></p>
