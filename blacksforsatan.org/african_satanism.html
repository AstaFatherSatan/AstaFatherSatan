			<span id="yiv4342142997yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1485362066535_19824">The 
			serpent has been worshiped in Africa since the beginning. In most of 
			the beliefs and practices of Africa, it is the highest form of 
			cosmic power, next to the Sun. The serpent is also analogous to 
			bliss, wisdom, benevolence and regeneration. &nbsp;It is a primordial 
			force.</span></div>
		<div id="yiv4342142997yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1485362066535_40476" dir="ltr">

			<span id="yiv4342142997yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1485362066535_37976">Many 
			of the traditional beliefs in Africa are left overs of the 
			traditional pagan religion of our ancestors which are branches and 
			sects of spiritual satanism. These traditions are thousands of years 
			old but have watered down and have become small fragments of the the 
			grand satanic way which all cultures practiced. Our ancestors knew 
			of the importance of spiritual advancement and were well on the way 
			until the coming of Christianity and other enemy programs.</span></div>
		<div id="yiv4342142997yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1485362066535_40478" dir="ltr">

			<span id="yiv4342142997yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1485362066535_23911">In 
			many traditional African beliefs, you have the stories of the 
			rainbow serpent heaven, underworld snakes and water, serpent gods 
			and guides and old python cults. There is also emphasis on metal 
			working and smithery, ancestor and spirit veneration and gaining 
			spiritual awareness and ascension through the gods, which are the 
			chakras and our old gods.<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			The Mande people in West Africa had knowledge of transforming the 
			soul through working with the "metals"(chakras) of the earth and 
			were skilled magicians.<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			In some of the traditional African beliefs, Satan and the gods are 
			blatantly referenced. In East Africa, the Maasai people still 
			worship and follow a being called "Enkai", this being was said to 
			have given the Maasai people the knowledge to farm and encouraged 
			peace,&nbsp; represented fertility and the Sun. <br />
			<br />
			Father Satan's name is "Enki".&nbsp; It is clear that the African 
			god Enkai and Enki are 
			the same being. "Enkai" means "One in the Sky" and "the most supreme 
			and unique".</span></div>

			<div id="yiv4342142997yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1485362066535_40095">
				In the Vodun/Voodoo religion, there are serpent temples and 
				ceremonies which use real snakes to symbolize the rebirth of the 
				soul and the initiation into priesthood. In Vodun, Legba is an 
				aspect of Father Satan. </div>

		<div id="yiv4342142997yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1485362066535_40440">
			In the Serer religion, the primary symbol of the divine and the 
			ancestors who have ascended are two coiled serpents. Similar to the 
			caduceus symbol. They are called Fan Qool/Pangool.<br clear="none" />

			The rainbow serpent, common in many parts of Africa, is another 
			meaning for the kundalini serpent and the chakras. As the serpent 
			moves towards heaven (crown chakra) he carries the thunder god on 
			his back. This is the life force and energy from the serpent. Snakes 
			and water are a common theme in many traditional African religions. 
			The Water is the life force and shakti energy. The feminine 
			principle.<br clear="none" />

			At the end of it all, this is why we are here. We need to renew our 
			ancestors traditions and fulfill our destiny- to finish what was 
			started. Satan and the Daemon gods are the way.<br />
