		On the subject of the Moors, it needs to be known, even if there are 
		Black people out there who want to be willfully blind and disregard 
		facts and logics. The Moors were Mixed race and Arabic people who were 
		Muslim. Evidence and research shows that they were of Primarily North 
		African descent, just like the inhabitants of North Africa today who are 
		also mixed race, i.e Eurasian, Arabic and of Black Sub-Saharan ancestry. 
		The Moors also had Black slaves as well as Blacks in their ranks.&nbsp;<div>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div>
			From the artifacts, paintings and such from the Moors, they all show 
			them to be of mixed descent and not Black.<br />
			<div>
				<div>
					They also practiced the Lie of Islam which is nothing but a 
					program of evil and was created by the Jewish enemy to 
					conquer and destroy the Gentiles (non-Jews) in the East.</div>

						<strong>Let's not also forget that the Arabs enslaved Blacks for 
						a very long time and it was very HORRIBLE, brutal and 
						fucked up. It was worst than the slave trade that 
						happened in America. Blacks do not seem to know of or 
						say anything about this but it happened-</strong>

						Below are two factual articles that show that the Moors

						Black people will refuse to see the truth...all for the
