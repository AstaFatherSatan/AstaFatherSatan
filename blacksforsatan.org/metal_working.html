		<span class="auto-style17">
		<span class="auto-style6">Metal working in Africa was and still is 
		considered a form of magick. Metal workers are feared and also respected 
		in some African societies because of their potential to benefit or 
		negatively effect the lives of those around them. These people were 
		venerated and held important positions in society alongside royalty and 
		other authorities.<br />
		<br />
		</span></span></span>
		<span class="auto-style17">
		<h1 class="auto-style10">In Africa, when one examines closely, there is 
		an ancient cultural reference to a spirit or god of iron and 
		metalworking. In the Yoruba this god is called
		</span>
		<span class="auto-style9">
		Ogun* </span>
		<span class="auto-style17">
		and in North Nigeria, the god is called </span>
		<span class="auto-style9">
		Ogu</span><span class="auto-style17">
		or </span>
		<span class="auto-style9">
		Gu</span><span class="auto-style17">. Traditionally in the West African region, one chooses 
		to make the position of smithing a sacred and secret trade.</h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style10">&nbsp;</h1>
		</span>
		<h1 class="auto-style3"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">
		<span class="auto-style17">
		<span class="auto-style11">In the Mande culture, blacksmiths are said to 
		control a force called </span></span><span class="auto-style16">Nyama </span>
		<span class="auto-style17">
		<span class="auto-style11">which is liken to chi, witch-power and prana 
		life force. It is a hot and wild force that must be mastered and used to 
		transform when forging metals that are worked with, ultimately creating 
		a form of powerful art. The ability to control this energy is said to be 
		carried through the family.&nbsp;They believed this ability to be hereditary 
		and that metal working is controlled by the ancestors and 
		spirits.&nbsp;Members of the blacksmith family are taught the Daliluw, which 
		is the secret knowledge of the use and nature of nyama.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="auto-style17"></h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style10"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">
		<br clear="none" style="line-height: 1.22em;" />
		</span></h1>
		</span>
		<h1 class="auto-style22">As quoted 
		from a book on art forms in Africa concerning the Mande people-</h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style3"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">
		<br clear="none" style="line-height: 1.22em;" />
		</span></h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style8">“Nyama is the foundation that nourishes the 
		institution of smithing, so that it may nourish society, is the simple 
		axiom that knowledge can be power when properly articulated…. One must 
		first possess it (nyama) in substantial amounts and then acquire the 
		knowledge to manipulate and direct it to capitalize on its potential 
		benefits. Acts that the difficult or dangerous—like hunting, or 
		smelting, and forging iron—demand that a greater responsibility of 
		energy and a higher degree of knowledge be possessed by the actor 
		(Perani, Smith 1998: 71)."</h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style3">&nbsp;</h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style18"><span class="auto-style11">It </span>
		<span style="line-height: 1.22em;"><span class="auto-style11">is 
		interesting to note that many of these blacksmiths and metal workers are 
		also practitioners of divination (seeing into the future or unknown), 
		amulet making and medicine and many were also trained to be high 
		priests. These initiates and trainees would separate themselves from 
		society and conduct many rituals before they went into the "mother" 
		(earth) to become a metallurgist. Rituals of purification and fasting 
		was done in preparation to engage in this sacred and magickal act and 
		ensure the timing was correct to go along with this.</span></span></h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style3"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">
		<br clear="none" style="line-height: 1.22em;" />
		</span></h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style10"><span class="auto-style17">In ancient Africa, the metal worker was often 
		seen as a very powerful sorcerer and had the power to direct the forces 
		of nature. The will of the smith was used to transmute metals despite 
		the danger in the act. It is also interesting to note that Mande 
		blacksmiths were called "the first sons of the earth" and near their 
		forge were the forms of the 4 elements present to aid in their smithing 
		and ritual practice.&nbsp;</h1>
		<p class="auto-style10">&nbsp;</p>
		</span><span class="auto-style20">
		<h1 class="auto-style10"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">The 
		blacksmith was known as an enlightened one and one who deals with 
		numerous amounts of universal energy.</span></h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style10">&nbsp;</h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style3"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">
		<span class="auto-style11">Though the actual act of forging metal is 
		performed in these African societies to make weapons and tools, the 
		spiritual and allegorical significance still remains. The Mande culture, 
		along with majority of true African culture, has been infiltrated. The 
		Mande still have their ancient beliefs but many of them have adopted the 
		poisonous program of Islam due to centuries of invasion. This is the 
		case in many traditional African religions such as in Vodun/Voodoo.</span></span></span></h1>

		<span class="auto-style11">

		</span></span></h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style10"><span class="auto-style17"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">The metal 
		working tradition relates to spiritual transformation and for those of 
		you not aware, "metal work" or "metal working" is spiritual alchemy and 
		the metals are the Chakras. </span></h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style10">&nbsp;</h1>
		</span><span class="auto-style20">
		<h1 class="auto-style10"><span style="line-height: 1.22em;">In my study 
		of metal working in traditional African religion, it seems that this one 
		spirit that has smithing, craft and metallurgy under his domain is in 
		association with Azazel and the other gods who specialize in spiritual 
		alchemy.</span></h1>
		<p class="auto-style10">&nbsp;</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style3">&nbsp;<span class="auto-style11" style="line-height: 1.22em;">Azazel 
		is known as a master at spiritual alchemy and in the Bible and in enemy 
		grimoires, it reads that he is known to have taught men to make swords, 
		shields and body armor and that he is a master at working with metal, 
		minerals and geology. This is all spiritual.</span></span></h1>

		<h1 class="auto-style3">&nbsp;</h1>
		<h1 class="auto-style19">In reference to 
		"first sons of the earth", it connects with the black race being one of 
		the first races created. It also references the Mande's connection in 
		working with earth, mining and using it to gain spiritual 
		transformation. Working with the earth in a spiritual way in alchemy.&nbsp;<br clear="none" style="line-height: 1.22em;" />
