THE ALL IMPORTANT CHART RULER<BR>
The chart ruler is the ruler of the sign on the ascendant. In cases where there is a sign intercepted in the first house, or a sign such as Scorpio, which is ruled by both Pluto [its main ruler] and co-ruler Mars, and any planets in the first house, these are co-rulers. The main and foremost chart ruler is the planet that is the primary ruler of the sign on the ascendant and this planet represents you. The chart ruler is the most important planet and is secondary to none. 


<P>CONJUNCTIONS OF THE CHART RULER/S TO OTHER PLANETS AND THEIR INFLUENCES:<BR>

<P>CHART RULER/S IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SUN<BR>
This aspect gives good health, physical strength, energy, and vitality. This is usually a fortunate placement, tending toward a long life and physical strength even in old age. The recuperative powers are very strong. Depending on the sign, this placement gives an optimistic disposition and offsets aspects of low self-esteem. The chart ruler in conjunction to the Sun helps to offset negative aspects. This placement also gives a sense of charisma and makes one well liked by others. The affairs of the house with Leo on the cusp are likely to be of importance and focus in the life. 

<P>CHART RULER/S IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MOON<BR>
The nature here is family oriented, sensitive, and emotional. These people often are fond of food and good cooks. They can have a nurturing aspect to the personalities and are caring and protective towards others. There is often pronounced psychic ability, with a tendency to absorb the feelings, emotions, and general tone of the environment around them. These people are moody and are often fond of places near water. They are maternal. Home and family are very important to them. Often there is a tendency for changes in the area of having different identities, aliases, and in going through phases in their lives. In some cases, they may change color of their hair and their style of dress quite often. The affairs of the house with Cancer on the cusp are likely to be of importance and focus in the life. 

<P>CHART RULER/S IN CONJUNCTION WITH MERCURY<BR>
These people are often intellectual, talkative and have good dexterity and physical coordination. They have active minds and can get bored easily. They are often fidgety and restless. This placement often gives a talent for athletics. 
The affairs of the house with Gemini on the cusp are likely to be of importance and focus in the life.

<P>CHART RULER/S IN CONJUNCTION WITH VENUS<BR>
This aspect usually makes one attractive, charming, gives beauty, artistic talent and a sense of good taste. These people have charisma, along with a pleasing personality and unless Mars is strong in the chart, they are usually refined and well mannered, with a strong dislike of coarseness or crude behavior from others. They dislike confrontations and prefer a harmonious and peaceful environment and relations with others. The affairs of the houses with Taurus and Libra on the cusps are likely to be of importance and focus in the life.


<P>CHART RULER/S IN CONJUNCTION WITH MARS<BR>
This aspect makes for an outgoing, hot headed, energetic, and combative nature. It is good for heath, energy, and vitality, but can make one rude, crude, coarse, and ill mannered. These people are generally impatient and like to get straight too the point. Details bore them. Mars in conjunction with the ruler gives competitiveness, athletic and martial ability, along with a fearless pioneering spirit. People with this placement are often born leaders. Many military leaders such as officers, generals and those who have important and lifelong careers in the military have this conjunction. The affairs of the house with Aries on the cusp are likely to be of importance and focus in the life.

<P>CHART RULER/S IN CONJUNCTION WITH JUPITER<BR>
Jupiter gives protection throughout the life. This aspect gives self-confidence, a cheerful nature, and optimism, and can offset negative factors such as low self-esteem in a chart. In some cases, they are life long students and many benefits can come from involvement with universities and other places of education. They can be overindulgent and fond of travel. This gives the personality a pleasant disposition and they are generally well liked by others. There is also a tendency to be large in some way, either large boned, tall or heavy. The affairs of the house with Sagittarius on the cusp are likely to be of importance and focus in the life.

<P>CHART RULER/S IN CONJUNCTION WITH SATURN <BR>
The tighter the conjunction, the more malefic the influence can be. There is often an inhibited personality, along with pessimism, in some cases hard luck, and an overly serious nature. Other aspects need to be taken into consideration. The affairs of the house with Capricorn on the cusp are likely to be of importance and focus in the life.<BR>
One tragic example I noted was a child named Lisa. Her mother put her up for adoption in infancy. She was adopted by attorney Joel Steinberg and his wife through shady means. Lisa endured six horrific years of extreme abuse at the hands of this couple, which ended when Joel Steinberg beat her to death. Her chart ruler, the Moon was in near exact conjunction with Saturn in Libra in her fourth house of home and family. Saturn in Libra is exalted and much more powerful in its influence in that sign, intensifying its malefic nature. She never even had a chance. 

<P>CHART RULER/S IN CONJUNCTION WITH URANUS<BR>
These people are often rebellious, freedom loving, original, unusual, and can even be eccentric. This aspect can give genius, a talent for electronics, invention, and an aptitude for mathematics. Nervous outbursts are common, along with a high-strung nature. People with this placement are likely to be very unusual and/or exceptional in some way. The affairs of the house with Aquarius on the cusp are likely to be of importance and focus in the life.

<P>CHART RULER/S IN CONJUNCTION WITH NEPTUNE<BR>
Neptune can have a malefic when conjunct a ruling planet. It is often found in charts of the mentally ill, those who are drug and/or alcohol addicted, those who are aberrant, weak willed, abnormally sensitive, and unreliable. These people are often impressionable and open to being deceived and taken advantage of by others. It is not good for the mental health. [Only with the conjunction does the aforementioned apply] On the upside, the chart ruler conjunct Neptune is found in the charts of many famous composers and musicians. Neptune is the higher octave of Venus in the ability to create beauty. Poets, artists, and dancers often have this conjunction. The affairs of the house with Pisces on the cusp are likely to be of importance and focus in the life.

<P>CHART RULER/S IN CONJUNCTION WITH PLUTO<BR>
Conjunctions with Pluto give intensity. There is ability and aptitude for magickal practice, intense concentration, and focus of the mind. This aspect gives a strong will, inner strength, and a do or die attitude. Death before dishonor characterizes these people; it is "all or nothing." This aspect is frequently seen in the charts of those who are born sorcerers. These people tend to transform those that they come into contact and interact with.
