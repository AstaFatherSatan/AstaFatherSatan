Last night, I heard the song "My Sweet Lord" by ex-Beatle George Harrison on the radio. The focus of this song was "Lord Krishna" A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Many extremely wealthy and famous people have searched and searched for answers to the meaning of life. Harrison, in spite of his millions was not given any priority by Krishna Guru A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, thus the song. 
<P>
This is nothing new, as many people are lost. Satan gives us knowledge and understanding. I know more now than I ever thought possible. This knowledge makes me feel secure, even though there is much more for me to learn. Knowledge itself is infinite. 
<P>
Knowledge is the key to everything. Understanding life and feeling confident along with a sense of direction, is very important for both personal and spiritual advancement. Many yogis, martial artists and others have power, but they do not have the knowledge concerning how to use it. Without the knowledge, it is useless in many areas except for walking on hot coals like fakirs or breaking boards and bricks. 
<P>
Satan guides us to grow in power and shows us how we can use this power and be the best we can be. Most people do not have any spiritual answers. Life becomes confusing and meaningless. Depression, drug and alcohol abuse, confusion, insecurity and apathy are the condition of many, regardless of material wealth and fame. 
<P>
Satan is the giver of knowledge. We learn when we are ready. I have found Demons are the best teachers. What they can teach us is way beyond that of what any human knows. Time and patience are needed. We learn as we go along, are ready, and are open. Satan and his Demons are always there with answers to our questions and to help and guide us.
