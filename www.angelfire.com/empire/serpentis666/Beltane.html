Beltane [Pronounced "B'yal-t'n"] is an ancient celebration of fertility. Beltane is also the Satanic New Year and is an ancient traditional celebration of spring. Fertility celebrations have their origins in Ancient Mesopotamia. Orgies took place along with feasting to encourage the fertility of food animals and the abundance of crops for the coming year. Beltane is directly opposite Samhain [Halloween] on the Satanic Calendar as Samhain is the time of reaping. Beltane is also the celebration of the return of the Sun, the planting of crops, and the rebirth of spring. 
<P>
In Ancient Mesopotamia, this fertility rite was known as “Zagmuku,” Zagmuku was celebrated at the first New Moon after the spring equinox. The Ancients also celebrated the harvest, directly opposite Zagmuku, which was the original Samhain. 
<P>
Because the holiday focused on rebirth, the original creation epic known the Enuma Elish, was recited on the fourth day of the festival which lasted 12 days. Originally, the celebration was in honor of the Sumerian God, Enlil [Baal] and this is where the name “Beltane” originates. In Mesopotamia, the New Year’s Festival also served to reaffirm the bond between the community and the Gods, the community was represented by the king in temple ritual, for the king was the one responsible for the continual tending of earthly harmony and was held accountable to the Gods. The king joined with the high priestess in the Inner Sanctum of the ziggurat, and both performed ritual sex. 
<P>
The Satanic year is based upon the natural cycle. The eight major Sabbats are the equinoxes and solstices of the Sun’s year [666], and the 4 cross quarter days that come between them. The four equinoxes and solstices are based upon the motion of the Sun. The equinoxes are at the center of the Sun’s movement and the solstices are the endpoints of the movement. These four solar points are cosmic events based upon the movements of the earth and Sun, symbolizing the interaction of light and darkness. “This date has long been considered a 'power point' of the Zodiac,
and is symbolized by the Bull, one of the 'tetra-morph' figures
featured on the Tarot cards, the World and the Wheel of Fortune. [The
other three symbols are the Lion, the Eagle, and the Spirit.]” &#185;
<P>These are also seen in the Egyptian Sphinx. 
“Astrologers know these four figures as the symbols of the four 'fixed'
signs of the Zodiac [Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius], and these
naturally align with the four Great Sabbats of Witchcraft.” &#178;
<P>Beltane is midpoint between the vernal equinox and summer solstice. Due to the alignment of the earth at this important time, telepathic communication with the Gods and spirit world is very open. This is an excellent time to communicate with Demons

<P>
 Beltane begins at sundown on the evening of, April 30. This custom originates with the Celts who always figured their days from sundown to sundown.
Sundown was the time when Druid priests lit the Baal-fires on the tops of hills. 
<P>
Beltane fires symbolized the spark of life and fertility. Traditionally, the Beltane fires were composed of wood taken from nine different types of trees and kindled on a specially prepared sacred grid. The grid was created by outlining a square on the ground and dividing it into eight smaller squares. Turf from the eight outer squares was dug out and removed, leaving the ninth square in the center intact. “The Beltane fire symbolized the central hearth of the community. ‘These local sacred hearths represented the mystic divine fire at the center of all things, whose spark of life is carried by each of us.” &#179;
<P>
The Eve of Beltane has traditionally been celebrated in the nude with orgiastic sex. Couples would pair off, jump through the flames of the bonfires, and go into the woods until dawn, engaging in all night sex after intense feasting. Wearing clothing or ritual robes was much too dangerous when jumping through the flames. Frequently, cattle were driven between two such bon-fires
[Oak wood was the favorite fuel for them]. The following morning they
were taken to their summer pastures.
<P>Celebrants danced nude around the maypole. The Maypole is derived from the Egyptian obelisk and represents the erect phallus [penis]. It is traditionally constructed from wood of the birch tree, the tree of purification. 
<P>“In the words of Witchcraft writers Janet and Stewart Farrar, the
Beltane celebration was principally a time of '...unashamed human
sexuality and fertility.' Such associations include the obvious
phallic symbolism of the Maypole and riding the hobby horse. Even a
seemingly innocent children's nursery rhyme, 'Ride a cock horse to
Banburry Cross...' retains such memories. And the next line '...to
see a fine Lady on a white horse' is a reference to the annual ride of
'Lady Godiva' though Coventry.
Every year for nearly three centuries,
a sky-clad [nude] village maiden [elected Queen of the May] enacted this
Pagan rite, until the Puritans put an end to the custom.” <sup>4</sup>
<P>
Other May Day customs include walking the boundaries of one's property, repairing fences, and boundary markers, performing chimney sweeps, participating in archery tournaments, dancing, feasting, music, drinking, and indulgence.
<P>
In Ancient Egypt, the spring fertility festival, celebrated during the season of Het-Her, was known as “The Festival of the Joyous Union.”
The energy of the earth sign of Taurus represents fertility and the commencement of the growing season; the union of the sun and the moon symbolized the fusion of the male [solar] with the female [lunar]; the new moon. The Ancient Egyptians celebrated this holiday with art, music, dance, performance and sexual intercourse. 
<P>
Joy of Satan Ministries is working to rid Satanism of all the Judeo/Christian vermin that has infested it for centuries. Another name for the April 30th celebrations is The Feast of Valbörg." We refuse to call this night "Walpurgis Night." <a href="SaintWalburga.html">"Walpurgis"</a> is the name of an Christian saint.
<P>
Years ago, large Sabbats were held on the Summit of the Brocken in the Harz Mountains of Germany. A Black Mass, feasting and orgies lasted until dawn, with dancing around a huge bonfire, and intense celebrating.
<P>
The Feast of Valbörg is the celebration of fertility that has its origins with the Vikings. The festival spread throughout Europe. At this time, the veil between the Earth and the astral/spirit worlds is said to be very thin. 
What is done on this night, especially at midnight [April 30 - May 1st] has special significance. All rituals, magick, spirit communications and related are much more powerful on this sacred night.
