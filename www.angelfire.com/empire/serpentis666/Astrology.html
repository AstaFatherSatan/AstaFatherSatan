Remember, the interpretations for each aspect, house placement and sign a planet is in is taken alone. You must take the placements of the other planets, signs, and house positions into consideration, along with the shape of the chart, and blend in everything. When certain placements and aspects confirm each other in that there are other supporting aspects that emphasize the same personality traits or life circumstances, then an accurate prediction can be made with interpreting the chart. Most charts have supporting placements and aspects, emphasizing certain traits or events in specific areas of the life. 

<p>IMPORTANT POINTS:
<UL>
<LI>Planets within 5 degrees or less of an angle [Ascendant, Descendant, Midheaven, or IC] or in the angular houses; 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th house are more powerful in their influence. This also includes aspects. 
<BR><BR><LI>Planets in cadent houses 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th are weaker.
<BR><BR><LI> Planets in their ruling signs are stronger.
<BR><BR><LI>Intercepted signs and planets are weaker.
<BR><BR><LI>Planets in their exalted signs are stronger; in signs of their detriment or fall, they are weaker. *See link to "noted placements," below.
<BR><BR><LI>Jupiter aspecting a planet strengthens and amplifies its placement and traits, Saturn and Neptune weaken it.
</UL>
 



<P>THE CHART RULER IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PLANET:
<br> The most important factor in the astrology chart is the chart ruler and co-ruler/s if any. The planet/s ruling the ascending sign/s and planets, if any in the 1st house [co-rulers]. There can be more than one ascending sign, in the case of an intercepted sign in the first house. The planet/s that rule the intercepted sign are co-ruler/s. 
In a natal chart, the ruler represents owner of the chart. With predictive charts, the ruler of the chart represents the person/entity for which chart is cast.

<p>WHAT SIGN IS THE RULING PLANET IN?
<BR>Unless there is a stellium, or more than two planets in another sign, the personality will be influenced most by the sign the ruler is in. If there is more than one ruler, this will add another aspect to the personality, and the reader must blend the two. With three or more chart rulers, the individual is complex, with different aspects of the personality and reactions at different times. If the signs are very different from each other, i.e., Aries and Pisces, the individual can be outgoing some of the time and introverted at other times.

<P>THE SIGN THE RULER IS IN IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SUN OR MOON SIGN.

<p>IN WHAT HOUSE IS THE RULER/S POSITED?
<BR>Whatever affairs are ruled by this house, they will assume importance in the life. For example, the chart ruler in the 12th will give psychic ability, the need for solitude, and a shy disposition, unless other factors such as planets in Aries and other outgoing signs contradict this. 

<p>WHAT DEGREE IS THE RULER/S CONJUNCT?
<BR> If the ruler/s is placed on a degree of significance, such as conjunct a fixed star or on a critical or noted degree, this will affect the life for better or for worse. 

<p>IS THE RULER INTERCEPTED OR RETROGRADE?
<BR>If the ruler is intercepted or retrograde, the latter half of the life will be better than the early years. A retrograde ruler and indicates a so-called "late bloomer," especially if more than two planets are retrograde. Many planets, even if the ruler/s is direct, when retrograde indicate the above as well. 

<p><a href="RULER.html">WHAT OTHER PLANETS ASPECT THE CHART RULER?  </a>

<p>WHERE ARE THE TIGHTEST ASPECTS?
<BR>The tighter the aspect, the more pronounced its influence is in the personality and the events in the life. Tight aspects, especially if exact, set off events when contacted by other planets through transits or progressions.  Look to the house placements for the type of event and the natures of the planets involved.

<p>IS THE RULER OR OTHER PERSONAL PLANETS CONJUNCT ANY FIXED STARS OR MOON'S NODES?
<BR>Planets that are conjunct fixed stars will be influenced by the nature of the fixed star. The south node is of fate, for better or for worse. The north node is often indicates special abilities or talents. Always look to the signs and house placements.

<p>STELLIUMS:
<BR> A stellium is a grouping of three or more planets in a certain sign, all connected by conjunction. In a natal chart, the sign will be dominant in the personality, and if the entire stellium is within one house, the affairs of that house will be emphasized in the life. 
When the stellium is transited by other planets, major life events will occur, as to the nature of the transiting planets, and the stellium. The areas of life represented by the house that contains the stellium will assume importance in the person's life. 

<p>TIGHT ASPECTS:
<BR> Aspects that have an orb of two degrees or less intensify the influence of the aspect. Exact aspects, especially if more than two planets tie in, are indicative of a life event that is fated.

<p>THE MOON'S NODES: Planets conjunct the Moon's nodes are of special importance. The Moon's nodes are of fate. Planets conjunct the north node are often benefitted, but not always. The south node is strongly of fate and when conjunct a planet, especially if tight, this is very fated for the affairs ruled by the house with the sign ruled by the planet. 

<P>WHAT HOUSES ARE THE MOON'S NODES IN? DO THE MOON'S NODES LINE UP WITH ANY OTHER DEGREES IN THE CHART?
<BR> Again, this is fated, especially if they line up with two or more planets, angles, or the degrees of certain house cusps. The year a fated event takes place can be seen in one's solar return. 

<p>PLANETARY CONFIGURATIONS:<BR> T-Squares, Grand Trines, Yods, and Stelliums all factor into correctly interpreting a chart. 


<p>Overemphasis on or a lack of an element, quality, or aspect, along with unaspected planets, if any are also very important for chart interpretation. 

<p>HEMISPHERE EMPHASIS:
<UL><LI>The majority of the planets on the eastern half [the directions are backwards on an astrology chart] MC [Midheaven] to IC, this person is usually free to make their own way in life and they dislike any interference from others. They are independent, self-starters who rely upon themselves.

<BR><BR><LI>With the majority on the western half [IC to MC] there is a strong need for others. Others have a say regarding one's life, and in extreme cases, others can control the person's life. In rare cases, there can be dependence on others for survival, as in cases of physical handicaps.

<BR><BR><LI>With the majority in the northern [bottom half of the chart; the ascendant through the descendant], personal privacy is important here. This person needs time alone, along with a sense of security. 

<BR><BR><LI>People who have the majority of their planets in the south [top half of the chart] are usually outgoing people, who are social. These people don't mind being the center of attention, or before the public. Most are extroverted and enjoy leadership roles.

</UL>

<p>Planets on significant degrees have a strong influence in the chart and the affairs they rule and/or the affairs of the houses ruled by the signs they rule will be influenced for better or for worse according to the nature of the degree. This also includes house cusps on noted degrees. For example, Mars placed on a bad degree is bad for the affairs ruled by the house with Aries on the cusp, and can also be unfortunate for the house Mars is posited in. Fortunate degrees should be noted to find where one's efforts will pay off, and where natural gifts, talents, and abilities are.


<p>PLACEMENT OF AND ASPECTS TO SATURN 
<BR>Saturn is where we get our ass kicked in life. Aspects from Saturn to the other planets, and the house and sign Saturn is in reveal where we will experience problems, limitations, losses, and denials in life. 

<p>IMPORTANT AND SENSITIVE POINTS:
<BR>The Vertex and anti-Vertex: these are important points of fate like the Moon's nodes. Often loved ones or others for good or ill will have an important planet conjunct the Vertex or anti-vertex. At the first meeting/beginning of a relationship, many times the other person's progressed planet/s will cojoin this point.

<p>THE EAST POINT AND WEST POINT
<BR>When a planet is conjunct one of these points its influence is emphasized in the chart, and the affairs ruled by the house with the sign on the cusp ruled by the planet assume more importance in the life.


<p>THE PRENATAL ECLIPSE
<BR> This is much like the vertexes, and Moon's nodes in the way of fated relationships, and events in the life.

<p>PLANETARY MIDPOINTS
<BR>Planetary Midpoints are important when there is a planet conjoining them or coming into conjunction by transit or progression.
