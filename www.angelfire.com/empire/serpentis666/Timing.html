Timing your magick with the phases of the Moon is essential for success. A rule
of thumb is to remember for white magick, this is best done while the moon is
waxing (increasing in light; new to full). The best time is as close to the full moon
as possible. Love spells, acquiring a new job, wealth success, and so forth.<P>
When the moon is waning (decreasing in light; full to new), this is the best time
for success in black magick and works of destruction, the best time being as
close to the new moon as possible. The waning moon is also a good time for
ending things, banishing spells and ending personal bad habits, losing weight.<P><BR>

<P><span>Moon in Aries</span>
<BR>Projects begun when the moon is in Aries often begin with much enthusiasm, but
tend not to last. This is a good time for inciting conflicts, high energy, me, mine,
war, knives, weapons, guns, quick but not lasting results, fire, sharp things,
metals, daring, sticking up for yourself, risk taking, independence and inciting
accidents. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the head or face at
this time. Magick ruled by Mars has the best outcome at this time.

<P><SPAN>Moon in Taurus</span>
<BR>Projects begun when the moon is in Taurus are usually permanent or long
lasting, especially when performed in when the moon is in the first ten degrees of
the sign. Money, finances, possessions, material things, sensuality, earth, greed,
permanence, wealth, things that increase in value, loans, bankers, slow but
lasting results, time delays. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the
neck or throat at this time. Magick ruled by the Earth and Venus are successful at
this time.

<P><span>Moon in Gemini</span>
<BR>Communications, short distance travel, a Gemini Moon is dualistic in nature and
rules over thievery, trickery, pulling a fast one, relatives, siblings and neighbors,
and computers. Gemini lacks staying power and projects begun when moon is in
this sign tend to change. Not a good sign for black magickal workings. More
neutral in nature. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the shoulders,
arms, hands, or nerves at this time. Magick ruled by Mercury has the best
outcome at this time.

<P><SPAN>Moon in Cancer</span>
<BR>Cancer rules over anything to do with the home, family, food, nurturing, the
mother, women in general. Things tend to last, as Cancer is a clingy sign. Good
for love spells, weather spells, altar consecration, blessing the home,
mediumship, psychic endeavors, inciting over-emotionalism. Spells for the success in buying land, purchasing real estate, a decent place to live, and
reconciling family members are best performed when the Moon is in this sign. Do
NOT have surgical procedures performed on the stomach at this time. With love
relationships or marriages begun when the moon is in Cancer, if the parties
break up, they often tend to reunite. Magick corresponding to the Moon is
successful at this time.

<P><SPAN>Moon in Leo</span>
<BR>Good for anything having to do with children, creativity, good for casting love
spells; romance, success in gambling, winning, attracting center stage, personal
charisma, men in general, the father, hobbies, speculation, risk taking,
investments, stocks and bonds, authority and spells for gaining positions of
power and authority over others. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on
the heart, spine, or back at this time. Leo is a fixed sign and projects begun when
the moon is in this sign tend to last. Magickal workings ruled by the Sun are
successful at this time.

<P><SPAN>Moon in Virgo</span>
<BR>Health, sickness, wellness, things that require precision and perfection, hygiene,
nutrition, herbs, vitamins, the armed forces, clothing, the work place, co-workers,
workings of white magick and healing for others, service to others. Things that
involve details. Hospitals, healing, the medical profession, institutions,
bureaucracy, red tape, attention to detail. Virgo tends towards change. Do NOT
have surgical procedures performed on the intestines, anus, or digestive system
at this time. Magickal workings ruled by Mercury are successful at this time.

<P><SPAN>Moon in Libra</SPAN>
<BR>Good time to form love relationships, marriages, partnerships of all kinds or cast
spells to ensure the success of or to incite these. Peace, diplomacy, negotiation,
legal matters, workings with two people, contracts, getting people to do what you
want them to do easily and peacefully. Do NOT have surgical procedures
performed on the kidneys or lower back at this time. Best for love spells.


<P><SPAN>Moon in Scorpio</SPAN>
<BR>This is one of the best signs for black magickal workings. Revenge, hatred,
venting, exposing secrets, death spells, surgery, transformation, obsession, pure
sex, the occult, the darker side of things, extremes, research, banishing spells,
ending things permanently, death and dying. This is the most powerful and
intense of all the moon signs. Secret, underhanded, and covert operations,
willpower, drastic destruction. Like its opposite sign Taurus, Scorpio is usually
permanent. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the pelvis,
reproductive or sex organs at this time. Magickal workings ruled by Pluto are
successful at this time.


<P><SPAN>Moon in Sagittarius</SPAN>
<BR>Religion, Universities, travel, higher education, gambling, good luck, good for
ceremonial magick, best for white magick, publishing, sports, the outdoors, the
law. Pulling off something big. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on
the hips or thighs at this time. Magickal workings ruled by Jupiter are successful
at this time.


<P><SPAN>Moon in Capricorn</SPAN>
<BR>When the moon is in Capricorn, this is another excellent time for black magickal
workings. Depression, ruthlessness, using people viciously, long-term results.
Honors, social standing, responsibility, authority, structure, setting long-term
goals and plans for the future. NOT a good time to seek favors from those in
authority. Magickal workings and spells that feature a time delay or are lasting,
wasting, manipulating people, business, banishing. Do NOT have surgical
procedures performed on the bones/skeletal system, teeth, or knees at this time.
This is a "ruthless" moon sign. Workings ruled by the malefic planet Saturn are
favored at this time.


<P><SPAN>Moon in Aquarius</SPAN>
<BR>Friends, groups, platonic relationships, society, electricity, workings within a
coven, computers, technology, individuality, originality, freedom, independence,
humanity, anarchy, the unexpected, bolt out of the blue, genius, revelation, goals
and ideals, shocking people. This is the best moon sign for spells of
independence and breaking away from restrictive situations. Freedom and
coming into your own. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the
calves or ankles at this time. Workings ruled by Uranus are favored.


<P><SPAN>Moon in Pisces</SPAN>
<BR>Poison, drugs, self-undoing, deception, sorrow, depression, isolation, insanity,
very deep psychic stuff. Good for success in meditation and all psychic pursuits.
Spells to deceive people, secrets, swindles, vulnerability. Secret enemies, altered
states. This is the one of best times for endings, especially when the moon is in
20-30 degrees of the sign (make sure it is not void). Psychic healing can be
done. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the feet at this time.
