Pluto, in prediction, is a neutral planet. Transiting Pluto brings major, life altering change, for better or worse, depending upon the other transiting planets and the life patterns in the birth chart. Pluto is neither positive nor negative. The changes resulting from a Pluto transit are permanent. 
<p>
Pluto rules intensity and obsession. When it contacts natal planets by transit, it sometimes intensifies them, especially in the case of Venus, where it can cause deep, obsessive love. The Venus/Pluto contacts are the bringers of fatal attractions where the love is one sided.

<P>TRANSITING PLUTO:

<p>To the natal Sun-
<BR>When Pluto contacts the Sun, there are changes in one's self image. This transit often brings one into contact with his/her own power. The Sun rules the male partner in a woman's chart, the Father, the male boss, men who are seen as authority, and children, especially male. These changes can affect these male figures in one's personal life. For example, rarely, there can be death of the father. The house cusp(s) with the sign of Leo (see) are areas there is likely to be major change. The house that contains the Sun can also be affected. Look to the house where Pluto is making the transit from, for clues to where the changes will take place.

<P>To the natal Moon-
<BR>Domestic change. Moving house, someone being born, someone dying, someone leaving, someone coming to live in the same house. or changes that affect one's family members and home. Look to other planetary transits to determine whether this change is positive or negative. Transiting Pluto aspecting the Moon from the 5th house, often signifies a birth. Pluto aspecting from the 8th, often a death.
<P>
To the natal Mercury-
<BR>Often a period of intense learning and mental activity. One will go through changes in one's views. During this transit, one may transform one's self through intense learning, either formal or informal. Meditation and other psychic exercises will act to transform the mind at this time. Also look to the house cusps with Gemini and Virgo; the house containing the natal Mercury and the house where transiting Pluto is making the aspects from. One may become obsessed with a subject.
<P>
To the natal Venus-
<BR>This transit usually incites deep, intense love. This love can descend into obsession, especially if one sided. There can be a painful quality to the love. Emotions can be out of one's control. There can be changes in regards to finances, as Venus rules money and material possessions. Check house cusps that have Taurus and Libra, the house containing Venus and the house where Pluto is making the transit from.
<P>
To the natal Mars-
<BR>This is a good transit for increasing one's self confidence and self esteem. During this time, one feels more in control and in some cases, receives outstanding recognition of some sort. People undergoing this transit, often find themselves more competitive, aggressive, determined, and intense. One often has more physical stamina and can devote him/herself entirely and intensively in a selected project. The project can become an obsession and much work can get done. Check the houses with Aries on the cusp(s); the house containing Mars and the house Pluto is transiting from for areas where possible additional changes will occur.
<P>
To the natal Jupiter-
<BR>Changes in one's religious beliefs, philosophies and views. With the conjunction, square, and opposition, these can be drastic. With the trine and sextile, one's beliefs can be deepened and strengthened. Check the house(s) with Sagittarius on the cusp, the house containing Jupiter and the house Pluto is making the transit from.
<P>
To the natal Saturn-
<BR>There may be changes in one's foundation beliefs. One's concept of reality may go through permanent changes. Enlightenment can be in the form of upheaval. This transit usually affects the affairs of the house(s) that has Capricorn on the cusp and the house containing Saturn. Saturn also rules old people and there may be changes in regards to them if one has any that are within one's personal circle. Look to the house where Pluto is making the transit from.
<P>
To the natal Uranus, Neptune and Pluto-
<BR>I have found when transiting Pluto contacts these natal planets, the affairs that undergo change are within the house cusps that contain the signs that they rule. Aquarius, for Uranus, Pisces, for Neptune and Scorpio for Pluto aspecting itself. With Uranus, in rare cases, there may be some change connected to one's freedom or lack of; Neptune, drugs, music, art, alcohol, Pluto to itself is a generational influence. Affairs with the house with Scorpio on the cusp can undergo changes.
<P>
To the chart ruler-
<BR>In addition to the above, there will be major, permanent personal changes. Look to the house where transiting Pluto is in to see what areas of one's life they will affect.
<P>
To the ruler of the 2nd house- financial, or material changes.
<BR>To the ruler of the 3rd house- changes in thinking, brothers/sisters, relatives, neighbors
<BR>To the ruler of the 4th house- changes in home, family, the mother
<BR>To the ruler of the 5th house- changes in regards to children; a birth, changes in regards to athletics or creative projects.
<BR>To the ruler of the 6th house- changes in health and/or work
<BR>To the ruler of the 7th house- marriage, divorce, sometimes legal issues, changes in regards to partnership.
<BR>To the ruler of the 8th house- changes in joint finances, debts, sex.
<BR>To the ruler of the 9th house- beginning or ending higher (university) education, possible long distance immigration, possible changes in religious beliefs/philosophies.
<BR>To the ruler of the 10th house- career changes
<BR>To the ruler of the 11th house- permanently joining a group or organization, permanent friendships or breaking up with the above mentioned. Permanent changes in goals.
<BR>To the ruler of the 12th house- changes in consciousness, in rare cases, imprisonment or incarceration. Good time for occult studies, spiritual understanding, meditation and healing.
<P>
