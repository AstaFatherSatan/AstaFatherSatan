<P>Kabalistic/Magickal Square of the Sun for material success,
prosperity, and earthly [non-spiritual] affairs

<P><IMG SRC="Sun_Material.gif">



<P>The mantra for the Sun is for 36 days in a row. It is important never to skip any
days, as this will cancel out the entire work.
<P>Begin the mantra when the Sun is strong in its home sign of Leo, or when it is in
its exalted sign of Aries. These times are ideal, but the mantra can be done when
the Sun is in other signs as well.
<P>DO NOT begin this mantra when the Sun is in the signs of Aquarius [detriment]
or Libra [its fall].
<P>Begin the mantra on a Sunday, during the hours of the Sun.
<P>Begin during daylight hours when the Sun is shining, preferably.
<P>Ideally, each day, the mantra chosen for the Sun should be recited during the
hours of the Sun for that day. This is ideal, but regardless, never skip any days,
regardless of the hour.
<P>Ritual/Magickal Rulerships for the Sun:
<BR>Confidence, fame, success in gambling, pleasure, securing popularity/charisma,
increasing health and vitality, healing, protection, success, magickal power and
riches. The Sun rules the third chakra, and of course the Sun in the astrology
chart.
<P>Parts of the Body ruled by the Sun: The heart, spine, diaphragm, arteries, veins,
and eyes, over-all health and vitality.
<P>Diseases: Low vitality, fatigue, all diseases of the heart, arteries, high/low blood
pressure, vision problems, jaundice, meningitis, all back and spinal problems,
seizures. [Debilitated/weakened/afflicted Sun]
<P>Professions: Acting, all theatre occupations, persons in authority positions
(bosses, supervisors, noblemen, kings, emperors), those who work with gold,
judges, magistrates, people in charge of huge sums of money, money lenders.
<P>The Sun is your ego, personality, self-esteem, vitality, leadership ability, health,
fame, and honor.
<P>The Sun rules: Your father, the men in your life, your children, your health/vitality,
your will, ambition, your self-esteem, and self- expression, your confidence, and
your third [solar] chakra. Precious metals, things of value, gold, all persons in
authority/power, the wealthy, the government,
<P>In your astrology chart: The house the Sun is posited in, along with the house/s
that has the sign of Leo on the cusp.
<P>The Kabalistic/Magickal planetary square working empowers the third [solar]
chakra and strengthens a weakened/debilitated Sun in one's astrology chart and
helps in the affairs ruled by the house/s with the sign of Leo on the cusp/s and
the house containing the Sun.
