We all have a right side and a left side brain. The left side of the brain is our conscious mind that we use every day to make conscious decisions and use logic. This is the active masculine side of the brain. The passive side is the right side of the brain. This is the receptive feminine side. The right side of the brain is highly suggestible and the side we access in both meditation and hypnosis. 

<P>In order to access the passive right side, the active left side must be subdued. This is analogous to turning off the electricity in a home or building in order to access the wiring. If the electricity is not turned off, a shock will prevent accessing any wires. The mind works the same way. 

<P>The more subdued the active left side is, the deeper the trance, the deeper the trance, the more receptive the passive right side is. 

<P>In order to effectively hypnotize yourself, you must be deep in a trance. To hypnotize another person, you must put that person deep into a trance- the deeper, the better. 

<P>In order to hypnotize someone, the operator must establish some sort of rapport. People who are highly suggestible, impressionable, and gullible make the best subjects. Those who are nervous, cynical, and uncomfortable with being hypnotized are difficult to work with. The CIA and other unethical professionals use barbiturates to put resistant subjects under. They use just enough so the mind will still be receptive to suggestions. If too much is used, the session will prove futile. 

<P>The success of the session depends upon how set the mind is regarding the suggestions. Chronic and longstanding problems, deep seeded hang-ups, and mental blocks require many sessions to overcome. The suggestions and affirmations must be repeated and repeated to break down walls in the mind. 

<P>With hypnosis, the operator is in control. The extent of this control with a professional is equal to the subject turning his/her entire life over to the operator who can command him/her to do anything. There have been numerous reports of psychiatrists putting their patients under and having sex with them. The patient was told during the session she would not remember the incident upon awakening. This is a common example. When you allow another person to hypnotize you, you are literally putting your entire life in their hands and with each session, you become more and more under that person’s control. 

<P>In order to prevent any other person from hypnotizing you, you have to program your mind that you will never be hypnotized by another person. This creates a block. Hypnotists have been known to place their own blocks in the minds of their subjects. Some have placed several. The most common is the subject experiencing total amnesia concerning the session. Other blocks used by unethical hypnotists include the subject only being able to be hypnotized by the operator and no one else. These involved court cases where the operator used the amnesic subject to commit crimes. The human mind can be programmed to experience amnesia given any situation.
