Scroll to the bottom for an explanation with interpretations. These are instructions for revamping the life force, transformation of the soul and becoming a God. This is Satan's Gift to humanity.
<CENTER><img src="HieroglyphicsOne.jpg" width="550" height="640"></CENTER>
<P>Note, the above, the closest wall to the view of the picture: 
<OL>
  <LI>The God is directing his sexual energy into his 3rd eye. 
  <LI>His feathered headdress indicates the lightness of feeling that comes with 
  this energy working. 
  <LI>The other God is holding a cone shaped object, this I believe indicates 
  concentration of energy, as the base is wide and the apex tapers to a point. 
  The concentrated energy is directed into the 3rd eye. 
  <LI>Beneath the God with the feathered headdress' penis is a loop like object, 
  indicating the circulation of sexual energy. 
  <LI>Above, in front of the God holding the cone is an Ankh, before the ankh is 
  another cone, indicating the concentration of the life giving sexual energy in 
  the ankh. 
  <LI>The God holding the cone is wearing a different headdress than the God who 
  is directing his energy. It is apparent the God with the cone is 
  instructing him. He has not yet reached the higher level of the God holding 
  the cone. This can be seen in the headdress which is a double feather, 
  indicating he has reached the stage where he feels the levetivity. The 
  headdress on the other God has a serpent (cobra) protruding from the front 
  where the 3rd eye is, indicating he has achieved the ascension of the 
  serpentine energy of kundalini. 
  <LI>Above the God with the feathered headdress, there are images of the 
  serpent, the cone of concentration and the ankh. 
  <LI>On the opposite side is a cartouche, depicting a scarab with a ball above 
  it. Directly beneath the cartouche appears to be readiating energy, the lines. 
  Beneath this are the feathers of lightness. Directly beneath another cartouche 
  containing an eye shape which I believe represents the 3rd eye again.The 
  looped symbol. This indicates this God standing opposite the god with the 
  feathers has achieved mastery and immortality. Look at the above carvings as 
  opposed to the God with the feathered headdress. There are 2 feathers, 
  indicating he has already accomplished this stage, has moved on to bring up 
  his energy and reach transformation and rebirth indicated by the scarab of 
  immortality. 
  <LI>The God on the rear wall is at a lower stage indicated by the serpent and 
  the Ankh being at a much lower level. The ball beneath his penis indicates the 
  building of the ball of energy through orgasm up in the 8-9th chakras of the 
  4th dimension. 
  <LI>The God on the farthest wall in front, has a loop shaped object, directly 
  beneath his penis indicating again, the circulation of sexual energy. The way 
  to immortality. 
  <LI>All three depictions are at different levels of achieving the goal of 
  immortality. </OL>
  <P>The Gods left these carvings in stone for those of us who are enlightened 
  enough to read and understand them, as they cannot be altered. They are 
  instructions and the heiroglyphs are deeply religious. Those of us who 
  understand are to teach and enlighten the rest. <BR>-High Priestess Maxine
