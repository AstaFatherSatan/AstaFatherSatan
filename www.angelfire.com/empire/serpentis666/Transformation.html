There are some things I feel I should mention
concerning power meditations. Unfortunately, in life,
rarely, if ever, does any serious transformation occur
without pain. People who want power- so called
supernatural power- will find in most cases, they will
have to go through pain in order to achieve this. 
</p><P>
Our bodies and minds are used to running on a certain
amount of life force. When we begin to make some
serious alterations with this very life force, certain
nasty side effects can crop up. This is a given and is
also individual. 
</p><P>
The life force, like any electricity is HOT. BURNING
HOT. There are different physical responses to extreme
heat within the body. Some of which are quite unpleasant.
Inflammations, eruptions, burning sensations, and so
forth are the most common. 
</p><P>
Knowledge is everything- to know what can be expected
is to understand. One clergy member found his metal
pendant that he always wears has become so hot it
burned a mark into his skin. 
</p><P>
This sort of thing passes, though it can take anywhere
from a week or two, to a few years. Once the physical
self adjusts, the soul has been completely
transformed. 
</p><P>
This is no different than strength and mass building
through weight lifting. I remember when I first began
working out- there were times I couldn't even get out
of bed I was so sore. It took a few years, but the
bone density and body strength/mass I have are
permanent. 
</p><P>
Remember, in meditation, the same thing. Unlike
physical exercise, once you enter a point, there is no
turning back. You can only move forward. Stopping can
be disastrous in some cases. One may lighten up, but
this will do little as a certain point has already
been crossed. 
<P>
Very few, if any articles or materials contain any
contraindications concerning the effects of advanced
meditation. 
</p><P>
1. People who are epilptics or have had any seizures,
should either take it EXTREMELY slow or not at all.
You are increasing the electricity within the body and
the brain- enough said? 
</p><P>
Even in normal people, physical adjustments to the
increase of electricity can cause mild siezures. 
</p><P>
2. Everyone should ALWAYS make sure the air they are
breathing in during meditation is clean. Deep
breathing is no different than aerobic exercise such
as running/jogging and will affect the lungs and
system accordingly. Cold air can cause pleurisy,
inhaling polluted air, lung problems. Keep this in
mind. 
</p><P>
Signs the Kundalini is about to ascend:
<p>
1. Spontaneous physical/electrical energy surges can
cause jerks, twitches, shaking, and energy waves and even convulsions.
<p>
2. Increased sensory awareness- heat, cold, sounds,
strong tastes, odors, heightened sense of body image
or absence of such, feeling a strong burning aura,
disturbing thoughts [this is why void meditation is
necessary to banish them as is a strong mind].
<p>
3. Sleeplessness, insomnia. One woman did not sleep
for 5 months
<p>
4. On the upside- increased understanding, much easier
communication with demons and the sixth sense is
increased and enhanced greatly. Feelings of extreme bliss, peacefulness. 
<p>
5. The external environment does not have any affect-
people getting angry, you remain calm.
<P>
This is the awakening stage of the Kundalini. Much will
depend upon the individual. One's health and any former
meditation done in the past. The stronger you are in
every respect, the less problems. 
<P>
Kundalini/bio-electricity is hot like molten lead. A
warm sensation at the base of your tailbone- some of
us have felt a pulling upward- sometimes spinning sensation. This indicates your Kundalini has been activated. 
<p>
All of the chakras must be completely open and
unobstructed. The serpent of fire will ascend piercing
through each chakra. For some people, this is as hot
as a glowing iron. One must stay focused and direct
the energy out of the crown chakra.
<p>
The Kundalini will sometimes crackle and roar as it
flashes like blinding white lightening as it hits the
6th chakra. This can be brightness beyond anything you
have ever experienced or seen in your life. This is
where calm, complete control comes in.
 
</p><P>
The Kundalini is individual for everyone. What some people
may experience, others may not.  
</p><P>
Here are some links that are informative. Gopi Krishna
writes extensively on the subject. He is said to have
suffered much during the transformation, but once this
was passed, he experienced extreme bliss beyond
anything he had ever known until the day he died.

<P>
Thoth wrote that the greatest obstacle to true
spirituality is FEAR. This is where the strong survive
the weak. One must have no fear. Father and your
Guardian Demon will guide you. They will also push you
when necessary. People say that they want
extra-normal ability and power- this is the way, but
nothing comes without pain in this life.
</p><P>
Many talk the talk, erroneously believing they are
"already a God." For most, this is just a legend in
their own minds.
