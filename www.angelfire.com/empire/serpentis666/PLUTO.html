<P><A HREF="PlanetPluto.html">ABOUT PLUTO [Link]</a>


<p>PLUTO IN THE SIGNS is generational, manifesting itself in world events, unless Pluto is the ruler or co-ruler of the chart, and/or prominently placed. Pluto brings permanent and drastic changes in regards to events. 
<P>Aries 1823-53
<br>Many of those born with Pluto in Aries were pioneers; explorers; the people who colonized the Western USA. In Europe and other parts of the world, the industrial revolution took place.

<p>Taurus 1853-84
<br>Economics went through lasting changes with capitalism, and the growth of industry and finance. Empires of wealth [monopolies and cartels] were established that grew out of the industrial revolution. Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Carnegie, and other plutocrats emerged on the scene. Taurus rules land, money, finances and property. 

<p>Gemini 1884-1914
<br>The generation with Pluto in Gemini made unparalleled advancements in technology and communications, such as the telephone, aircraft, the phonograph, motion pictures, the automobile, the radio, and many more. Travel and communication took a huge leap forward.

<p>Cancer 1914-1938
<br>The crash of the stock market, the Bolshevik revolution, World War I, the depression and the entrance into World War II. This restructured the home and family. Women began working in factories, and families were torn apart. Cancer rules the Moon and the Moon rules women. Skirts came up off the ankles, and the ratification of the 19th amendment gave women the right to vote. The women of this generation were given greater freedom and rights. Pluto rules death and many with Pluto in Cancer had their homes and families destroyed in the war. Nearly all home and family life was drastically altered during this time.

<p>Leo 1938-56
<br>The Pluto in Leo generation were the baby boomers; those who brought us the hippie generation. Leo rules pleasure. Attitudes towards sex changed and the sexual revolution took place, and recreational drugs became popular. Leo rules children; no longer were single mothers treated with disrespect, as in former times. Leo also rules love and love became free. Leo also rules authority and pride. The people of this generation were either hippies or they were militants. 

<p>Virgo 1956-71
<br>This generation has given us all the health clubs, with promoting alternative medicine, along with a "healthy" diet. People of this generation are in pursuit of the perfect physique. These people have also advanced medical technology as never before. Virgo rules health and day-to-day work. The workplace has also drastically changed with new technology such as the computer and the internet. 

<p>Libra 1971-83
<br>This generation will change the laws and the justice system, [Hopefully for the better]. In addition, there will be changes regarding marriage and divorce. 

<p>Scorpio 1736-1748; 1983-95
<br>Here is the generation of freedom fighters and revolutionaries. Many were born with Pluto in Scorpio, who fought in the US Revolutionary war and the French Revolution. This generation made major changes in overthrowing tyranny. The collapse of communism and the USSR, and the end of the Berlin Wall, along with the reunification of Germany, all occurred when Pluto was in Scorpio. The people born with Pluto in Scorpio changed the world and will do so again to bring in the Age of Aquarius. When Pluto was in Scorpio, 1490-1502, the "New World" was discovered and everything changed forever. Pluto went into Scorpio, at both the beginning and the end of the Crusades: 996-1008, 1243-1255. This ended the Dark Ages and opened the way for the Renaissance. 

<p>Sagittarius 1995-2008
<br>The last time Pluto was in Sagittarius [1748-1762], great advances were made in making education available for everyone. When Pluto was in mid- Sagittarius, the year 2002 and after, [this sign also rules religion], the Christian Church finally was exposed, [planet Saturn was tying in and opposing Pluto from Gemini], the sign of media and communication; they could no longer hide their crimes against humanity. When the generation with Pluto in Sagittarius reaches maturity, [usually after their first Saturn return; ages 28-30] they may finally put a permanent end to what is left of that odious institution.

<p>Capricorn 1762-1778, 2008-2023/24
<br>Revolution, and the overthrow of tyranny. All around the world, repressive governments and powers were forcibly removed. The Declaration of Independence was signed.

<p>Aquarius 1778-1798, 2024-2043
<br>Aquarius rules the common person. America established a new form of government where monarchs and dynasties no longer had the rule. The common people had a voice in government. The next transit of Pluto in Aquarius should signify the reality of the Age of Aquarius. We are now in the last days of Pisces. Aquarius is the sign of freedom and enlightenment.

<p>Pisces 1798-1823, 2043- 
<br>The first submarine was built; Pisces rules the oceans and water. There was much travel across the Atlantic Ocean with immigrants coming to America and the New World. 

<P><BR>PLUTO IN THE HOUSES
<P>1st house
<br>These people have a powerful will. They are intense, have natural psychic ability, and their early years are often filled with hardship, leaving lasting emotional scars. Early childhood was marked with efforts for survival. The families of those born with this placement were often in extreme poverty. These people tend to be loners and keep their innermost selves aloof from others. Their feelings run deep and they can be difficult to get to know on a personal level. 


<p>2nd house
<br>There is often an obsession for material wealth and money. These people can be greedy. Focus on attaining one thing can become an obsession. There can be secrecy involving assets, and even drastic changes regarding finances.


<p>3rd house
<br>These people will keep reiterating themselves, as quite often with this placement, one did not feel listened to as a child. He/she was often ignored, especially by adults. They express their thoughts and opinions intensely. There is often an obsession with knowledge and research. A nervous breakdown can occur sometime in the life, [especially if the Sun conjoins this Pluto by progression], leading to regeneration of the mind. People with this placement often have very strong opinions, and communicate intensely. They can be responsible for secret information of extreme importance. There can also be a sibling with strong Scorpio/Pluto emphasis in his/her chart, or in a position of power. There can be intense activity in the immediate environment. These people are often on the go and have more errands than they can handle. Quite times are often spent in study and learning. 


<p>4th house
<br>Often, the mother and/or father are controlling, domineering and interfering well into the adult life. For example, the mother who calls her adult children every day, keeps tabs on their whereabouts and activities, even when they are adults. One way or another, people with this placement more than often have issues with the mother for better or for worse. In rare cases a parent may die early in life. 
There can be close ties with the earth, a talent for dowsing, and geology. There can be involvement in mining and working underground. Power struggles can often occur with parents or other family members. There can be childhood trauma or physical abuse, leaving people with this placement to feel as if they have no control over their lives. In some cases, positions of power may come to these people later in life.


<p>5th house
<br>There can be severe losses through gambling. Pluto in the fifth house can bring an addiction to gambling. These people can maker for domineering, overly strict, or even abusive parents. There is much creative power with this placement. Love affairs are usually deep and passionate. Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac for these people. Extra-marital affairs are common with Pluto in the fifth house. 


<p>6th house
<br>Morticians, pathologists, miners, those who work in salvage industries and on government atomic projects are likely to have Pluto in the sixth house. There can be secrecy involving the job. Spiritual healers also are known to Pluto in the sixth house. There can be extreme physical strength and stamina, along with strong recuperative and regenerative powers. This placement can also bring problems with the sexual and/or reproductive system, including sexually transmitted diseases. 


<p>7th house
<br>Here the marriage partner can be overly jealous, controlling and even physically abusive. This is a position that battered wives often have. Their lives can be drastically altered by marriages and partnerships, and even with their relations with other people. People with this position need to be cautious regarding whom they associate with. The partner is more than likely to have power over this person; the wrong kind of power. This goes for both sexes. In extreme cases, one who is involved with this placement can wind up dead. Murderess Susan Atkins with Saturn, Pluto and Mars all in her seventh house of others, was strongly attracted to Charles Manson. Needless to say, he brought out the worst in her and the association transformed her life in a very ugly way. 


<p>8th house
<br>This placement gives formidable strength and endurance, along with a remarkable life force. There is often a high sex drive. Life is serious business for these people, and many have a do or die attitude. Occult gifts such as clairvoyance, clairaudience, and telepathy are pronounced and very common with Pluto in the eighth house. These people have a natural talent for research and investigation. There can be secrecy in regards to hidden debts, and in extreme cases, there can be dealings with loan sharks and money involving underworld connections. These people often have secret sexual fetishes.
They are prone to getting involved in drastic life/death circumstances. Many activities are carried on in secret and only manifest during the final stages of development. People with this position must have a sexual outlet for their over all mental and physical health, as their drive is much stronger than most and can turn into other things of an unpleasant nature, if not attended to. One noted person with Pluto in conjunction to Neptune in the eighth house achieved the Magnum Opus. 

<p>9th house
<br>There can be religious fanaticism, often with drastic changes in spiritual beliefs later in the life. These people love mysteries, puzzles and mind games. In-laws may be controlling and/or manipulative; they may be people of power and influence. The second marriage partner may be as Pluto in the seventh house [see the above]. There are often strong ambitions to achieve recognition in areas of higher education, and/or spiritual attainments. These people can have rigid and fanatical moral dogmas, having little tolerance for others and pushing their beliefs. This placement is also indicative of militant atheists. Whatever the individual with the ninth house Pluto believes, or disbelieves, there is a strong tendency towards fanaticism. 


<p>10th house
<br>The father [ruled by the tenth house] is often of a domineering and controlling nature. He may be in a position of power and influence. People with this placement have a talent for dealing with those in positions of power and authority. The career or goals of these individuals can become an obsession, with a strong tendency towards being a workaholic. Whether or not people with this placement attain power or status, they are more than likely to attract the attention of those who do. There can be secretive circumstances surrounding the career. 

<p>11th house
<br>Those with this placement often have powerful friends, and competitive friendships. Friends can be of a jealous nature as well as possessive, controlling and domineering. There can be involvement in occult groups, along with positions of leadership, and/or power within groups/associations. The groups these people belong to can be secretive, and sometimes of a very serious nature. Those with Pluto in the eleventh house can be dominated and manipulated in some way by the groups they join, even involving life and death..."blood in, and blood out" so to speak.


<p>12th house
<br>People who have Pluto in the twelfth are often intensely lonely. There is much psychic ability and spiritual talent. In some cases, they can be extremely private, and need their time alone. There can be powerful and even deadly enemies. Those with this placement are capable of deep meditation, intuitive understanding, and are frequently adepts at black magick. They are very telepathic by nature. Pluto in this house can be a protector, destroying enemies and preventing personal losses.
