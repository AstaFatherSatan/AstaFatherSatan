<P><A HREF="PlanetSun.html">ABOUT THE SUN [Link]</a>

<P>*Remember, the interpretations below are for the Sun in the signs and houses all by itself. You must take other planets, signs, and house placements into consideration when reading a chart. 
<P><br>THE SUN IN THE SIGNS
<BR>Aries 
<BR>Outgoing, self-starting, hotheaded, selfish, pioneering, leadership abilities, pushy, bossy, quick to anger, but the anger doesn't last unless there is a strong Scorpio emphasis in the chart. 'Me first' attitude, impatient, competitive, bold, fearless, loud mouthed, and energetic. Aries all by itself is notorious for beginning projects, but not finishing them. The more emphasis on Aries in the chart, the more self-centered the individual will be. Aries people love to talk about themselves, their lives and often disregard the needs of others. They put themselves and their own interests first. 
<P>
Taurus 
<BR>Sensuous, stubborn, slow, indulgent, artistic, persevering, fond of good food and material comforts, sensuous, possessive, jealous, good money managers, can be greedy and materialistic, can have an obsession with money. Taurus is one who sticks to plans. If you tell a Taurus or one who has a strong Taurus emphasis in their chart you are going to do something, then follow through on it. They hate to have their plans altered, especially if there is an emphasis on fixed signs in the chart. Taurus is one who dislikes changes, unless there are many mutable signs in the chart to offset this tendency. Though traditional astrology texts claim Taurus is 'slow to anger,' I have found Taurus people can have a tendency to angry outbursts frequently. 
<P>
Gemini 
<BR>Changeable, dual nature, spontaneous, intellectual, verbal, fond of learning, reading, active mind, diverse interests, scattered, easily bored, jack-of-all-trades, can do many tasks at once, flexible, adaptable. Geminis have very active minds. They tend to fidget with their hands and have a lot of nervous energy. Geminis can change their mind, alternating between two entirely different points of view at different times, often not knowing themselves which stance they take on certain issues. They can say one thing one time, then say the completely opposite another time. When one is subordinate to a Gemini boss or individual in authority, one often finds one must go with the flow so to speak, as Gemini can change on a daily basis, even going as far as bending or reversing rules, methods of work application and related on a whim. The word 'vacillating' definitely applies to Gemini. This is especially emphasized when one also has an emphasis on mutable signs in one's chart. 
<P>
Cancer 
<BR>Moody, family/home loving, protective, childish, nurturing, clingy, lives in the past, great cooks, food is love to these people, chronic worriers, the women nag, Cancers hate criticism and ridicule, especially when it is in front of others. They make good parents and try to mother others. They hold grudges and never forget an offense. Many Cancer people have a fascination with the past or a certain era or time period of the past. Most Cancers have excellent memories, since this sign rules the past. They tend to take things personally. Many come across as hard and tough, but deep inside they are the most sensitive souls. They are natural born empaths, along with Pisces. They can feel another's pain. Cancers often take abuse from others or attract abusive relationships. This is so because of their opposite- Capricorn, which is ruled by Saturn. This is especially true when Cancer is on the ascendant. They are naturally intuitive and absorb the emotions and feelings of others and their environment. Security, along with a loving home and family are very important to a Cancer's emotional well-being. Cancer is the mother sign of the zodiac and these people are excellent at taking care of others, tending to those who are ill and in need of personal attention. 
<P>
Leo 
<BR>Proud, leadership ability, stubborn, inner strength, arrogant, dramatic, loving, hates to fail, loves to brag, loves to be center of attention, show off, generous, creative, fun loving. Flattery will get you everywhere with this sign. Step on their pride and that is unforgivable. Leos need to have fun and recreation. They are natural born actors and have a dramatic flair. Leos have strong wills and their sense of pride can make them fiercely competitive. When their pride is at stake, they will fight to the death. They must be able to express themselves freely for their own emotional and psychological health and well-being. Leos are natural born leaders. 
<P>
Virgo 
<BR>Clean, neat, orderly, hard working, hygienic, critical, can be cruel, a perfectionist, detail oriented, health conscious, gossipy, concise, analytical, excellent at getting things organized and done, work is very important, nit picky. Virgo can be one who asks endless questions, especially personal questions. Virgos are naturally critical of others, especially once they get to know you. Work is their life. They are the ones who can be depended upon to get a job done. They have an attention to detail- details most other people often miss. Their attention to detail can make them miss the larger issues. This is a modest and unassuming sign all by itself. They are not inclined to brag unless there is a strong Aries or Leo emphasis in the chart. Being an earth sign, they are practical. They are prudent with their money and not inclined to spend foolishly or without thought, or to waste anything unnecessarily. They are concerned with their health and many take care as to what they eat, drink, and put into their bodies. Some can become hypochondriacs and over concerned with germs.  

<P>Libra 
<BR>Libras need others. They have a strong sense of fairness and justice. They are artistic, peace loving, well-mannered, good mediators, and will take abuse to keep the peace. They often have a difficult time maintaining their own individuality. Libras abhor bad manners and coarse, crude behavior. They function at their best when they have the support of a partner/lover. They work best with others as part of a team instead of alone. They are as a rule, well mannered, refined, and tactful, unless there is a strong Mars and/or Aries emphasis in the chart. Relationships of all kinds are important to these people. They hate to be alone. The more emphasis on Libra in one's chart, the more there is a strong need for significant relationships in the life. 

<P>Scorpio 
<BR>Strong willed, secretive, strongly sexual, intense emotions, insightful, revengeful, possessive, jealous, detests weakness in others, violent anger, they make very dangerous enemies, natural occult abilities, sadistic. Scorpio is the sign of the natural mage, the gifted, and the adept especially at black magick. Scorpios are exceptionally strong willed, but their intense emotions can be their undoing. Scorpios feel deeply and are rarely neutral on any important subject. They have a very strong sense of justice, never forgetting a kindness but never forgetting an offense against them either. They are ones who are adept at revenge. Unlike Aries, Scorpio's anger is lasting and is like an overturned wasp's nest and can be violent and deadly. One with a strong Scorpio emphasis often has piercing eyes. This is especially true when Scorpio is on the ascendant. Scorpios have a very difficult time detaching. They try to hold on to those who are important to them and also they desire to control them. Scorpio is a controlling and dominating sign.  
Scorpios have their secrets and are intensely private. They are not one to reveal their personal life to others, even those who are close to them. 
<P>
Sagittarius 
<BR>Happy go lucky, rarely learns from mistakes, loves to gamble, loves travel, tactless, irresponsible, loves education, horses, the outdoors; overconfident, better at starting things, than completing them, impractical.  Sagittarius is the sign of good luck, as it is ruled by the benefic planet Jupiter. Luck often comes to Sagittarius and this sign has more of its share of millionaires. When Sagittarius is emphasized in the chart, often these people rise to the top in their chosen profession. A predominance of college professors, judges and those who have careers in high places and in the travel industry have an emphasis on Sagittarius in their charts. They are very fond of the truth and can be blunt and tactless when stating their minds in front of others. They need their freedom. Sagittarius all by itself cannot tolerate possessiveness on the part of others. They are life long students who enjoy learning either formally or on their own. They love travel and have an interest in foreign cultures and peoples. When Sagittarius is strong in the chart, most often the individual will be well traveled. 

<P>
Capricorn 
<BR>Old when young, young when old, lacks self-confidence, serious, patient, has much endurance, conservative, cautious, needs to plan activities, needs life to be ordered and defined, prefers to work behind the scenes, shy, sensitive, money is god, materialistic, never gives up. Capricorns have a tremendous sense of endurance. They are the ones who outlast everyone else. They are natural born pessimists, especially in their younger years, looking on the negative side of everything and they can be intensely negative at times. They are reliable and practical. They can also be cold hearted and ruthless. They have a serious nature and are hard working. They are normally conservative with their money and their time. Like Taurus, they prefer to plan things ahead and to stick to their plans. Capricorns are responsible and career oriented. They are ambitious and enjoy being in positions of authority and power, but not inclined to show off or be in the lime light. Capricorns are shy by nature. 
<P>
Aquarius 
<BR>Friends are important to Aquarians. They are freedom loving, they like to shock others. They are unique and original, hate possessiveness, work better in a group than individually, and are determined, impartial, rebellious, and stubborn. They look to the future, are natural born inventors, and humanitarians. Equality and fairness are important to these people. Aquarius people are interested in the new, the modern, and the future. They are cool headed and not ones to become overly emotional. They are ones who will stand up and fight for the rights of others and social issues. They are innovators and have little interest or patience with the past and outmoded ways of doing things. These people desire for and create changes when it comes to traditions. They are concerned with humanitarian issues and causes, striving to make the world a batter place. In order for Aquarians to be happy, they must have friends. Like Libras, they do not like to be alone and work best as part of a team. Emotionally, they are detached. They are very fond of new ideas and progressive ways of doing things. They are fascinated by and look toward the future. 
<P>
Pisces 
<BR>Idealistic, dreamers, masochistic, self-sacrificing, creative, artistic, intuitive, weak, kind, gullible, romantic, self-pitying, extremely sensitive, compassionate, sympathetic, takes on other people's troubles, puts up with abuse from others. Pisces is the weak sign of the zodiac. When there is a strong emphasis on the sign of Pisces, the individual is often of a weak nature. They are naturally psychic and intuitive and very inclined to daydream and fantasize. When Pisces is very strong in the chart, one can have a masochistic nature. They are natural born empaths, and like the sign of Cancer, they can feel another's pain and suffering. They are extremely sympathetic and compassionate and will readily make concessions and/or self-sacrifices for another. They have a tendency towards shyness and are peace loving. They are one of the easiest signs to get along with in a relationship. 

<P>THE SUN IN THE HOUSES

<BR>First house 
<BR>Gives health, good for recuperative ability, vitality, energetic, gives strength, optimism, strong will, helps offset bad placements in the chart. The Sun in the first is a fortunate placement. This placement gives the ability for leadership. These people are proud and individualistic. Look to the sign the Sun is in for more information as to character traits, as the Sun in the first is a co-ruler. 

<P>Second house 
<BR>Helps with finances, likes to spend money on recreation, athletics, entertainment, and fun. Material items are an expression of the self. The self-esteem is directly connected to one's material and financial status. There is a strong need for financial independence, and self-sufficiency. 

<P>Third house 
<BR>Good for writers, those who have careers in communication, and teachers. Learning and knowledge are important to these people. They take pride in what their knowledge. Brothers, sisters, and neighbors are emphasized in the life. Communications of all kinds are focused upon with the Sun in the third house. These people often educate themselves informally through book learning and other related ways outside of attending a school setting. Their self-esteem is connected with their ability to communicate effectively, and they take pride in what they know. They are life-long students and ask many questions. 

<P>Fourth house 
<BR>Home and family are important. The mother may have been dominant or might have taken the role of the father in raising the child. There is pride in family, and the family and family background is often connected to the self-esteem. Prosperity and security come later in life, especially if the chart ruler or more than three planets are retrograde. Here one wants to dominate the family and takes a leadership role in the home. Early clashes with the parents in some cases were likely. A secure comfortable home is very important to these people. There is often a fondness for tradition and the past. There can be a strong interest in real estate, land, the earth, ecology and the environment. 

<P>Fifth house 
<BR>Creative, athletic ability, risk taker, competitive, pleasure loving, fond of children and animals. One with a fifth house Sun must be able to express him/herself freely. These people have a strong need for fun and pleasure. They are romantic and dramatic by nature. This placement loves show and being in the limelight. They love to be noticed. Careers in theatre, the arts, dancing, recreation and working with children are favored by the Sun in the fifth house. 

<P>Sixth house 
<BR>The sun in the sixth is a poor placement for health. Work and service are important here, these people can be workaholics, and they are excellent workers. They will put 100% into their jobs. This is not a good placement for one's vitality. The health is often fragile and recuperation following an illness can be lengthy. There is much personal pride in one's work and the self-esteem is directly connected to the work and doing a satisfactory job. People with this placement need to be appreciated and noticed for the work they do. 

<P>Seventh house 
<BR>The marriage partner may be dominant, compares success to that of others, success may come from opportunities and/or assistance provided by others, a strong need for others and a marriage partner. These people do not like to be alone. They take pride in their relationships and their self-esteem is connected to the marriage partner. They are at their best when they have the love and support of a significant other. These people often have a strong influence on the lives of others.

<P>Eighth house 
<BR>Strong willed. Power is important to these people, interest in self-improvement and application of the will, good for bankers and those who handle the money of others. Many of those in powerful positions have an eight house Sun. There is sometimes in the case of famous people, more recognition after their death. They desire a deep soul to soul relationship with a lover/marriage partner. They have the power to transform themselves and others. 

<P>Ninth house 
<BR>Love of travel, interest in spiritualism, higher education, likes to impose these views on others, these people will travel far from home, other cultures can shape belief system, and there is a love of sports. Self-esteem here is often connected to one's level of education, especially formal education. These people often go for advanced college degrees and educational honors. They are often authorities on certain subjects and areas of knowledge. They take much pride in their level of formal education, their travels, and what they know. 

<P>Tenth house 
<BR>Powerful or dominating parent, success, power oriented, authoritative, strong will to succeed, ambitious, personal reputation is important, families can be of prominent social standing, wants to set a good example for others, the Sun in the tenth often gives a high position and/or emphasis on the career in the life. Self-esteem is connected to one's social status and the career. Honor and recognition, both socially and in one's career are important to these people. The father was more than likely dominant, important and a powerful lasting influence in the life. These people enjoy being before the public. 

<P>Eleventh house 
<BR>Friendships are important, powerful friends, enjoys leadership with group activities, and help can come from friends. They like to belong to fraternities, groups, and organizations. The social life is important. These people are at their best when working as part of a team. Friendships can last a lifetime. These people usually have many friends and spend most of their time with others. They dislike being alone. They have humanitarian natures and a strong sense of brotherhood and fairness. Often there can be friendships with those who have a strong Leo emphasis, or with those who are in positions of authority.

<P>Twelfth house 
<BR>There is much psychic ability. These people need some time alone. They are usually shy, and can be lonely souls, as the Sun in the twelfth can indicate loneliness and estrangement from normal human contacts. There is an interest in the occult and in spirituality. They prefer behind the scenes activity. This placement like that if the Sun in the sixth is not favorable for the health. The health is often fragile and attention to diet, hygiene, and exercise is needed. Vitality can be low, especially if there are Sun/Saturn or Mars/Neptune aspects. 

<P>ASPECTS OF THE SUN

<BR>Sun/Moon
<BR>The stronger the Moon is in light, the more beneficial its influence in one's chart. 

<P>Sun conjunct Moon [New Moon] 
<BR>This strengthens the house where it is found and gives the affairs ruled by the house special emphasis in the person's life. There is a very strong emphasis on the sign the conjunction is in; unless both luminaries are in adjacent signs. There is a tendency to be very concentrated, putting all of one's energy into something, to the exclusion of all else, with a strong focus in the life related to the house placement. 
<P>
Sun trine/sextile Moon
<BR>Those born during a waxing Moon, if there are few or no planets retrograde, will tend to experience things early in the life, such as love relationships, unless other placements and aspects in the chart contradict this. This is a harmonious aspect for emotional expression. For those born during a waning Moon, and especially if the chart ruler/s and/or more than three planets are retrograde, success will come later in the life. The person is a late bloomer.
<P>
Sun square Moon [Quarter Moon]
<BR>Family life may have been unsettled, when growing up and parents may have not gotten along. The same applies for the above 'Sun trine/sextile Moon' in the way of life's experiences in regards to a waxing or waning Moon. 
<P>
Sun opposition Moon [Full Moon]
<BR>Here, the individual can swing between opposites. Simplistic and subjective thinking such as seeing things in black and white, good or bad, right or wrong, etc. Relationships are important to this individual and he/she is best when involved with others and not alone. 
<P>
Sun/Mercury 
<BR>This aspect gives much mental energy. If combust 1/2 degree to 4 degrees, this can give a person a tendency to jump the gun where thinking is concerned and to be ahead of themselves. The combust conjunction also can give a mental and/or intellectual blind spot in some way. There can be nervousness and a tendency to be high-strung. There can also be problems with the nervous system in some way. Sun/Mercury gives intellect. 

<P>Sun/Venus 
<BR>This is the aspect of the narcissist, as it gives vanity. These people are concerned about their appearance and are the ones who rarely venture out if their hair, clothing and for women makeup are not in place. Much pride is taken in the appearance. Also gives artistic talent. 

<P>Sun/Mars 
<BR>This gives health and energy. With the conjunction, this is strongest. The house with the conjunction will experience much activity. [Look to the affairs ruled by the house]. A strong competitive nature and a desire to achieve are often present. All Sun/Mars aspects help with the energy, vitality, and recuperative abilities. There can be a tendency to headaches and fevers. This aspect also gives aggression and self-assertiveness and is very helpful in offsetting planetary placements and aspects, which encourage shyness. The houses with Leo and Aries on the cusps will be emphasized in the life as areas of much focused activity. 

<P>Sun/Jupiter 
<BR>This is an aspect of over confidence, even with the soft trine and sextile. With the hard aspects, one will make themselves at home in another's place of residence, taking over. They often act like they own everything, whether it belongs to them or not. They can be very arrogant and imposing. This also gives energy and health, but lesser than Sun/Mars. In charts where there is a tendency towards low self-esteem, shyness, and such, this aspect can be of some help, but most often, there can be a split in the behavior, swinging from overconfidence and arrogance to feelings of inferiority. 

<P>Sun/Saturn 
<BR>Low self-esteem, low energy/vitality, problems with and/or estrangement from the father in childhood. There are often problems with men for both sexes, but especially for women. Reserved in self-expression, can make a person awkward or over serious. For women, the husband/partner can be more like a father figure, dominating or restricting. When transiting Saturn makes its first hard aspect to the Sun in a young girl's life, often around the age of 13-14, she may develop an outright hostility towards her father. This often lasts through the life. Look to the houses where the hard aspects are taking place and where the Sun is placed to see where the individual feels lacking in self-worth. With the hard aspects [the opposition, conjunction, square and inconjunct], marriage usually comes late in life. The trine and sextile aspects often give longevity and are more toned down in their affects as to the above, adding seriousness and discipline to the personality. 

<P>Sun/Uranus 
<BR>Independence is very important to these people and they hate being told what to do. Here we have the natural born rebel. They dislike conformity, routine and have somewhat of a high-strung nervous temperament. Most people with this aspect are very original and unpredictable. There can be a natural talent for working with electronics. These people are very willful. 

<P>Sun/Neptune
<BR>This aspect brings confusion about the self, and self-deception. These people are often confused as to their abilities and personal self. These people sometimes feel over confident, other times they doubt their abilities. Growing up, there was often much confusion in the home, especially with the hard aspects. One or both parents may have been inconsistent in the areas of setting rules, administering discipline and such. This aspect [especially with the hard aspects- the conjunction, square, opposition and inconjunct] indicates a father who was addicted to alcohol and/or drugs. Sun/Neptune hard aspects are often present in the charts of those who have a weak father. Many, again with the hard aspects, were victimized by their father in some way, even if the father did not intend this. Bad advice from the father when growing up and often a general bad example is common with the hard aspects. The soft aspects such as the sextile and trine give strongly developed intuition and psychic abilities. The soft aspects can also bestow creative talent in the arts, in acting and with dancing. 


<P>Sun/Pluto 
<BR>With Pluto, the Sun being a parent planet, representing the father [the Moon represents the mother] with the hard aspects, the father may be controlling, dominating and possessive. In some cases, the father dies early. The father is often of considerable influence and importance in the life, either through loss, or an abnormally close relationship or through his attempts to dominate and control. The father is often seen as powerful and imposing. This is true with even the soft aspects. 

<P>Sun conjunct the north node [born during an eclipse] 
<BR>This bestows special abilities and gifts, usually of an occult nature. This is not good for the eyesight though.
