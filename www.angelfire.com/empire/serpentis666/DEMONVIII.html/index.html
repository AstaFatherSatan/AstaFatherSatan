<BR>Shax has short blue hair with a medium build and dark skin. He gives one a feeling of power that comes from his aura. He is very powerful in his magick.
<BR>Shax is a good Demon. If you ask him several questions he will totally ignore the ones not related to the task at hand [i.e. love, etc].
This is likely because, judging from his character, he is accustomed to human
interaction; he is a people Demon. I have no doubt as to his answers, he
answers quickly and accurately, and would not be the sort of Demon
anyone would wish to cross. He is very powerful. His residual
energy was very helpful.
