<A HREF="Herbal_Info.html">IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT HERBS</A>



<P>Herbs by themselves have little magickal power. In order to practice powerful
witchcraft using herbs, the herbs must be infused with power. This is advanced
magick and requires the ability to invoke/evoke and direct the elements. Each
herb carries elemental properties that correspond to its medicinal uses. These
can be found under planetary rulerships. In addition, to really empower herbs,
planetary hours should be observed to amplify any working.

<P>Various mediums are used during any ritual or magickal working. For example,
the proper candles act as a beacon to spirits and the proper uses of various
colors, imagery, and herbs can assist the effectiveness of a working.
 
<P> Herbs have long been employed in the workings of magick. Through the power of
scent; incense, perfume, herbal oils used for anointing one’s self, anointing
candles, sigils and talismans; purification bathing before ritual, and with some,
ingestion.
 
 <P><UL><LI>The <span>flower</span> parts are used for scents or in the stuffing of poppets, sachets,
and pillows or for a bath water additive.
 
 <P><LI>The <span>wood parts</span> can be used to construct implements and tools for
magickal purposes.
 
 <P><LI>The <span>leaves</span> are very versatile and can be used in the making of ointments,
oils, bathing, and the stuffing of poppets, pillows, steeped and drunk as a
tea- MAKE SURE IT ISN’T POISONOUS AND YOU AREN’T ALLERGIC
TO IT!

<P><span><LI> Aromatic gums or resins,</span> along with the wood, bark, and oils can be burnt
as incense. It is always a good idea to burn some incense as a test before
any important ritual to determine how well it burns, and the quality of the
fragrance. Bad incense can be a major distraction and can ruin an entire
ritual, not to neglect in mentioning, being offensive to the spirits.
</UL>
 
<P><span> Incense,</span> like candles, provides a favorable environment for the manifestation of
spirits, for the affecting of the psyche and the attraction of the appropriate
planetary and zodiac force. It is essential to coordinate these elements.<P>
Certain scents are employed to act on the mind during ritual. These odors can
stimulate any emotion from anger and extreme rage, to sexual arousal and lust,
to peace, relaxation, and tranquility. The use of scents assists in heightening the
emotional output needed to give enough power to the working so that it will
manifest in reality. 


<P> <span>Oil</span> is for anointing one’s body, and can be added to bath water before a ritual.
Candles can be anointed to create the added fragrance, as the flame will give off
a stronger scent. Strong oils can be used to anoint the areas of the chakras, and
are used in ointments that can be rubbed upon one’s body for certain effects.
 
<P><span> Balsams </span> are the fragrant drippings from certain trees and plants. These can be
made into ointments and used as a rub for one’s body or object of purpose. The
purpose of rubbing one’s self with oils, balsams, or resins is to induce the proper
mood for ritual work.
 
 
<P> For example, plants ruled by Mars are fiery, burning, and acrid. When the oil,
balsam, or resin is applied under the armpits or other sensitive areas of the body,
it will incite the wrath and hatred needed in spells of revenge and torment, as it
will encourage a strong focus on pain and misery.
 
 <P> Plants ruled by Venus can be used in workings of love spells the same way, as
they stimulate and sooth.
 
 <P> Plants that have properties as aphrodisiacs, causing extreme sexual arousal are
good for spell work in inciting lust in another person of choice. The increased
arousal is focused upon the person desired. With stronger and/or multiple
orgasms; the energy thereof, being properly directed into the desired one, the
spell is that much more potent. 
 
 <P> Herbs correspond to zodiac signs, planets, and the elements. Fresh plants
contain the most energy. If you are using fresh plants, try to pick them when the
planet they are influenced by is strong and waxing in power.
