<p><br>MARS IN THE SIGNS

<P>In Aries 
<BR>Those with Mars in Aries are confident, highly competitive, aggressive, courageous, enthusiastic, bold, honest, and are never afraid to take a stand. Never one to back down, as a rule, they are hotheaded and often irate about something. Though the temper is hair trigger temper; their anger does not last long. Mars in Aries can offset low self-esteem aspects and shyness in a chart. This placement also gives health, much energy, and strong vitality, but is common with having headaches. If there are other Aries planets in the chart and/or an emphasis on fire signs, there can be much self-centeredness and a lack of awareness regarding the needs of others. These people are fighters and enjoy combat and friction. They are born leaders. Mars in Aries is bossy and pushy, often with a big mouth, especially if prominently placed. An emphasis on water signs can offset these tendencies. 


<P>In Taurus 
<BR>People with Mars in Taurus are sensuous with a strong sexuality. This placement gives determination and endurance. As with Mars in the second house [the second house is ruled naturally by Taurus], the energies are focused on acquiring material possessions and wealth. Mars in Taurus can give artistic talent along with fine tastes if there are other placements and aspects within the chart that support this. The nature is persistent and stubborn. Mars in Taurus gives a strong physical constitution and the ability to recuperate. These people are capable of performing difficult and demanding physical labor, unless other factors in the chart strongly contradict this. They are known for their thorough approach, operating at a slower pace, with attention to details. Mars in Taurus is jealous and possessive by nature in regards to love. 


<P>In Gemini 
<BR>These people are talkers. They love to talk and to express themselves. They can be fidgety and become bored easily, being high-strung with an abundance of nervous energy. Women with this position are attracted to lovers who are highly intelligent and communicative. They can be inclined to cheat when in a love relationship, especially if they feel they are not being treated well, or if they grow bored, much like the men who have Venus in Gemini. The mind is active and there is a fondness for word puzzles and similar games that engage the mind. Mars in Gemini is good at argument. These people can be prone to indecision and often change their minds and stances on different topics, especially if there is an emphasis on mutable signs in the chart. The energies are focused into communications and intellectual activities. Mars in Gemini is not favorable for staying power and many who have this placement often begin projects of which they get bored with and are off to something new; finishing very little. This placement gives dexterity and physical coordination, especially if other placements in the chart support this. 

<P>In Cancer 
<BR>These people are born Worriers, they often hold their anger inside and can have stomach trouble from this such as ulcers. When the anger is expressed, it is often in the home, among family members. Security is very important to them. The energies are directed into the home and family life. They often find it hard to assert themselves, and will beat around the bush so to speak and sulk when their needs are not met. They can be moody, touchy, easily upset, and volatile. The men often have trouble expressing softer emotions. Both sexes are inclined to hold grudges. In some cases, as with Mars in the fourth house, there can be domestic violence in the life. 


<P>In Leo 
<BR>These people have an enormous amount of personal pride. They are born show offs, and know how to impress others. They are natural leaders, are creative, and have a strong will. There is a need for independence and self-sufficiency. They expect complete and total devotion in love. Anyone who is in love with a Mars in Leo person should give him/her as much attention as is possible, for the relationship to be happy. There is much energy, willpower, and creativity. Mars in Leo gives acting ability. As with other fire signs, there can be self-centeredness, with a lack of awareness regarding the needs of others. This placement gives self-confidence, and can offset aspects that give low self-esteem. There can be exceptional talent in the arts and with music, especially if other factors in the chart support this. 


<P>In Virgo 
<BR>The energies are focused on work. These people are competitive in their work, and make excellent workers. They have an eye for detail and are thorough. They are clean, neat, and organized by nature. Mars in Virgo can nag and criticize endlessly. They can point out and see faults in things and people that others often overlook and miss altogether.

Mars in Virgo is a perfectionist and can be very particular and fault finding. The digestive system is sensitive and there can be stomach upsets from worry. The temperament is often nervous and irritable. They find lazy people to be intolerable. They are responsible, reliable, and hard working. 


<P>In Libra 
<BR>Energies are focused on relationships. These people are peace loving. Mars is in its detriment in Libra and the aggressive, quarrelsome nature is greatly offset. They have a very strong sense of justice and fairness. Because the assertive tendencies of Mars are neutralized, especially if there is a strong emphasis on earth and water signs in the chart, these people can have a difficult time with being direct. They may hint at what they want and act out in certain ways that need to be interpreted and read by those who know them. They can hold their anger inside rather than inviting an open confrontation. Like Mars in Gemini, they can be prone to indecision and can change their minds often, along with their points of view and stances on things. They are at their best when in a loving supporting relationship. These people value cooperation with others, and can be peacemakers. 


<P>In Scorpio 
<BR>Mars in Scorpio gives a very strong will and personal intensity. These people can see through the weaknesses of others. They can make for deadly enemies and have a strong sense of justice. They are vindictive and if someone wrongs them or a loved one, they will exact their revenge, even if it takes years. They do not forget an injustice. They are not ones to openly express their anger, but rather they smolder. This position gives a talent for concentration, focus and for meditation. They are natural mages and many have a talent for black magick that is inborn, from previous lives. The sex drive is very strong and pronounced. Energies are focused on sex, spirituality, and occult subjects. When pushed, the anger can be like an overturned wasp's nest. They are possessive and jealous in their affections. They demand total devotion and loyalty in a love relationship. If this is betrayed, they can become deadly. Rarely neutral about anything, they are strongly opinionated and either love something or hate it. The emotions are very deep and intense. 


<P>In Sagittarius 
<BR>Mars in Sagittarius gives an honest nature. These people are adventuresome; they love travel, the outdoors, and are restless and energetic. Like Mars in Gemini, they can be fidgety, easily bored and they can have trouble sitting still for too long. They often feel they are invincible and take high risks, as Sagittarius is the sign of gambling. Their optimism and confidence many times bails them out of even drastic situations. There can be problems with gambling and impracticality, in repeating the same mistakes and not learning from past experiences. When sublimated, energies are focused into higher education and learning. These people can be life-long students. Mars in Sagittarius gives natural athletic ability and a love of sports, especially of other factors in the chart support this. They are direct, blunt in their communications, opinionated and have strong beliefs. 

<P>In Capricorn

They are attracted to humanitarian concerns and often work to make positive reforms that are helpful to society. This placement often gives scientific ability, with a strong interest in the future, technology and the advancement of humanity. They have little patience with old outworn modes of doing things, structures, and like to replace these with new and better methods. 


<P>In Pisces 
<BR>Those with Mars in Pisces are often shy, withdrawn, and even timid. Like those with Mars in Libra, they can have a difficult time expressing their anger. The aggressive and assertive tendencies of Mars are watered down in Pisces. There is often a lack of self-confidence and the ability to stand up for one's self. The vitality is often low.
