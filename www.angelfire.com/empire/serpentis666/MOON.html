These people have an incessant curiosity, and are easily bored. Their thinking is strongly influenced from past experiences and early childhood. They have powerful imaginations and natural intuition. Much nervous energy gives these people the ability to do several things at one time. They can become distracted easily and lose their concentration, thus it is often difficult for these people to concentrate unless there are strong Mercury/Pluto aspects and/or an emphasis on Scorpio in the chart. As a rule, they dislike routine. Neighbors are often regarded as part of the family, and in some cases, their home is a hangout for friends in the neighborhood. 

<P>Fourth house 
<BR>The mother often has a strong zodiac sign of Cancer background, or the Moon as her chart ruler. There is a strong need for a family in order for these people to  be content.

<P><BR>ASPECTS OF THE MOON

<P>Sun/Moon
<BR>The stronger the Moon is in light, the more beneficial its influence in one's chart. 

<P>Sun conjunct Moon [New Moon] 
<BR>This strengthens the house where it is found and gives the affairs ruled by the house special emphasis in the person's life. There is a very strong emphasis on the sign the conjunction is in; unless both luminaries are in adjacent signs. There is a tendency to be very concentrated, putting all of one's energy into something, to the exclusion of all else, with a strong focus in the life related to the house placement. 

<P>Sun trine/sextile Moon
<BR>Those born during a waxing Moon, if there are few or no planets retrograde, will tend to experience things early in the life, such as love relationships, unless other placements and aspects in the chart contradict this. This is a harmonious aspect for emotional expression. For those born during a waning Moon, and especially if the chart ruler/s and/or more than three planets are retrograde, success will come later in the life. The person is a late bloomer.

<P>Sun square Moon [Quarter Moon]
<BR>Family life may have been unsettled, when growing up and parents may have not gotten along. The same applies for the above 'Sun trine/sextile Moon' in the way of life's experiences in regards to a waxing or waning Moon. 

<P>Sun opposition Moon [Full Moon]
<BR>Here, the individual can swing between opposites. Simplistic and subjective thinking such as seeing things in black and white, good or bad, right or wrong, etc. Relationships are important to this individual and he/she is best when involved with others and not alone. 


<P>Moon/Mercury 
<BR>These people are generally talkative, and enjoy discussing their families and home life. They have a good memory, as the Moon rules the past and Mercury rules the intellect. They tend to take things personally. They can be over concerned with any gossip or rumors, including any remarks from others directed at them. They have a strongly developed intuition and their thoughts often focus on their home family and on emotional matters. With the hard aspects, there can be impatience and a learning disability along with an inability to concentrate.

<P>Moon/Venus 
<BR>These people have much artistic ability, charm, and good taste. They are often good cooks, and have much domestic ability. They are affectionate and loving. With the square, this can delay marriage if other factors support it. The hard aspects can make one feel unloved and/or unappreciated, and family members can interfere with the love life in some way. The hard aspects can make these people overindulgent and over concerned with luxuries and materialism. 

<P>Moon/Mars 
<BR>Hot tempered, and easily angered, the family usually gets the brunt of their anger, in some cases resulting in domestic violence. These people can be rude, crude, and very coarse in their manners, especially if Aries is prominent. Children with this placement have temper tantrums. There is often jealousy and resentment towards others. These people feel and act with great intensity. On the upside, they can accomplish much for a cause if their energies are disciplined. Many of those born with Moon/Mars aspects, especially with the hard aspects, can become violent and nasty when drunk or under the influence of recreational drugs. The hard aspects also influence these people to spend their money foolishly and impulsively. Because the Moon rules the home and family, and Mars is the planet of conflict, there are often clashes with parents and/or family members. There is impatience and a dislike of routine. 

<P>Moon/Jupiter 
<BR>Favors good relations with the mother. These people are often self-indulgent. Food is love to them. They are of a generous nature and are emotionally attached to their home, family, friends and material possessions. They tend to get overly emotional and can over react to things. They are strongly protective and nurturing towards those they care about. They are often very emotional concerning their beliefs and philosophies.  

<P>Moon/Saturn 
<BR>Often, there are problems with the mother. The mother may have been emotionally absent, cruel, and/ or a negative influence. These people are defensive and self-protective. This aspect can be indicative of emotional depression. Most people with a Moon/Saturn aspect are hard working and disciplined. In many cases, Moon/Saturn people often had to assume heavy responsibilities when they were very young, such as caring for younger siblings. Emotional safety and security are very important to these people, and as a result, they often hide their emotions. They put duty before their own personal needs such as in caring for elderly parents or dependent family members. 

<P>Moon/Uranus 
<BR>Possible separation from the mother in childhood, or the mother was unusual in some way. Family and domestic life may be unusual in some way. These people enjoy the strange and unique. There can be sudden extremes of emotion. Freedom is extremely important to these people. With the hard aspects, one might have experienced some trauma in childhood, which can be lasting in the psyche. As with the Pluto/Moon aspects, those with Uranus/Moon aspects often desire to completely break with their past in some way. There can be sudden and unexpected domestic changes with the hard aspects, along with emotional outbursts.

<P>Moon/Neptune 
<BR>Impressionable, vulnerable, and gullible, these people can be open to victimization. The mother may have been a drug abuser and/or alcoholic, unreliable or just not there for them emotionally when they were growing up. In some cases, the mother is idealized and looked to as perfect. The same can be with the childhood in the way of remembering it as pure and faultless. These people, being psychic often have powerful and prophetic dreams. They are easily influenced, and have a very active imagination. Ugliness, vulgarity, and crude behavior affects them, as they are deeply disturbed by it. This aspect bestows much creative and artistic ability. Many are adept at acting, dancing and the arts. There is often a sense of dreamy idealism regarding the home and family. 

<P>Moon/Pluto 
<BR>This aspect often indicates a dominating mother. There are usually close ties with the mother that last through adulthood. In some cases, the mother may have died early in the person's life, but this is rare. The mother's influence I the person's life is very strong for better or for worse. The tighter the aspect, the more the mother figures in the life, especially with the hard aspects. In bad cases, the mother controls the person's life. These people in some cases with the hard aspects can completely cut all ties to their families, as there can be a strong desire to break with the past as with the Moon/Uranus aspects. There can be a so-called 'skeleton in the family closet' of which they are ashamed. These people are emotionally intense.

<p><br><a href="VOID.html">ABOUT A VOID OF COURSE MOON</A>


<P>Born on a Void of Course Moon:

<BR>Whatever house has Cancer on the cusp; the affairs ruled by the house are exceptional in some way. One born on a void of course Moon is often a very unusual and/or outstanding person.
<P>
Eva Braun, Adolf Hitler's mistress/wife had the ruler of her 7th [marriage/partners] with the sign of Cancer on the cusp, ruled by a void of course Moon in the 8th house of power, representing Adolf Hitler - enough said?
