Last night, my family and I went to the local Wal-Mart
to buy groceries. I openly wore my Baphomet at the time. When we got to the checkout, the woman behind
the register said "Jesus." I don't know why, but I automatically said "Satan." Then she said "Jesus" again.
This went on back and forth about four times. The woman was also rude.
<P>
My husband left after we had our groceries rung up to
look for the kids. I had to go to work that night and I was
debating on what I should do. I stood there waiting and
sure enough, I turned around and this guy who works for
the store was practically in my face. I asked him for
the manager and he said he was the manager. I complained
about the woman and how she treated me because of my religious symbol. I politely explained
that "This is America." I also politely added that I
could call the A.C.L.U. and file a law suit. I said I had
to go to work and the woman "upset my entire night"
[this can be grounds for legal action]. I also explained that the
woman is "clocked in on the job." The manager
apologized and said he would take action.  
</p><P>
Father Satan was telling me something here: the coincidence that my husband left to look for the kids [I had to wait], and that the manager just happened to be right behind me in a huge store.
</p><P>
Tolerating insults and discrimination against Satan, as an adult in a situation that is not life threatening, is turning the other cheek
and is an insult to Satan. If I hadn't said anything,
I would have been stewing all night at work and even the next day.
<P>
Complaints should be handled politely and in a
professional manner, but should never be avoided. This
discrimination has to stop. Only when we take appropriate action can this
stop and Satanism can be open and free.
