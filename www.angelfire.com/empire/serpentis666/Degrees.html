<table><tr><td><img src="Elements.gif"><td>0-1  Degrees of all signs signify the beginning of important events in one's life with predictive astrology, such as solar and lunar returns.

<br><Br>29 Degrees of all signs bring about the ending of events in the life, such as relationships, leaving a place of residence and so forth with predictive astrology, such as solar and lunar returns.

</table>

<p><BR>0-1  Degrees of Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn are extremely critical degrees, both in predictive and natal astrology. These are the four cardinal signs; the solstice points of the Zodiac. What has begun may or may not last. Cardinal signs indicate strong beginnings, but lack the stability of the fixed signs or the adaptability of the mutable signs. 0 -1 of Libra oftentimes signifies the beginning of a relationship in predictive astrology. The affairs ruled by the planets on these degrees, the houses they are posited in and the house cusps with the sign they rule in a natal chart, are usually of significant importance in the life. 


<p><BR>0 -1 Degrees of Taurus is always permanent, in prediction, for better or for worse.
<p><BR>0 -1 Degrees of the other fixed signs: Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius are long lasting. Fixed signs signify permanence, stability, and things that last. In predictive astrology, what has begun will more than likely last.
<p><BR>0 -1 Degrees of Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces are beginnings subject to change. Mutable signs always signify adaptability, restlessness, and change. They can be vacillating and weak. In predictive astrology, what has begun is subject to change.
<p><BR>29 Degrees of Pisces signifies a permanent ending in predictive astrology, as is 29 degrees of Taurus.
<p><BR>13 and 26 Degrees of Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn give special importance to the planet/s or house cusps occupying the degree. The affairs ruled by the planets, the affairs ruled by the houses ruled by the planets, or by the houses these degrees are on point to something of the above-mentioned occurring in the life of the chart owner.

<p><BR>9 and 21 Degrees of Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius have a tendency to misfortune. 21 Degrees of Scorpio is a definitely a degree of loss, both natally and in prediction, but the loss is not always negative.

<p><BR>4 and 17 of Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces are similar to the 13 and 26 Degrees of the Cardinal signs.
  
<p><BR>15 Degrees of Leo is one of the worst degrees in the zodiac, either natally or in prediction. Prominent in the charts of serial killers, felons serving life sentences, in the charts of those who have fated hard luck, etc. Helen Keller, both blind and deaf from a very early age had her chart co-ruler Mars at 15 degrees of Leo, along with no air signs. [Air signs are communication]. Stevie Wonder [blind] Pluto at 15 degrees of Leo, Ludwig van Beethoven, deaf, Saturn at 15 degrees of Leo. 

<p><BR>25 degrees of Leo is violent, and some who have this are in prison for violent crimes, especially those with their chart rulers on this degree. In addition, this is not a good degree for a planet to be on in a predictive chart. Problems will result from this placement according to the affairs it rules and/or house it is in. This is a very strong degree of alcoholism. Many who are chronic alcoholics have prominent planets on the 25th degree of Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, or Aquarius. The influence is especially strong if Neptune is involved.

<p><BR>15 Degrees of Taurus, Scorpio and Aquarius are also unfortunate, but not to the extent as 15 degrees of Leo, one of the worst degrees in the Zodiac.

<p><BR>16, 17, 18, 19, 22, and 25 Degrees of Taurus are all degrees of violence. 

<p><br>9 Degrees of Gemini and Sagittarius are both degrees of homicide.

<p><br>17 Degrees of Gemini is degree of homicide. 

<p><BR>6 Degrees of Cardinal signs: Cancer, Libra, Capricorn, and Aries indicates a possible physical disability, and to a lesser extent, especially if the planet occupies the first house, is prominent and/or other factors in the chart support this.


<p><BR>6 Degrees of Leo and 6 degrees of Aquarius are both very bad for eyesight.

<p><br>12 Degrees of Leo is a degree of beauty. 

<p><BR>9 Degrees of Virgo and Pisces are known as fatal degrees, body in the ditch degrees and degrees of suffering.

<br> 9 degrees of Pisces is one of the worst degrees in the Zodiac.

<p><BR>9 Degrees of Sagittarius is a warrior degree, and is also a degree of homicide. Prominent planets on this degree are also seen in the charts of religious and spiritual reformers. 


<p><BR>22 degrees of all signs, especially the fixed signs is bad, either natally or in prediction.



<p><BR>FIXED STARS:
Allow 1 - 2 degrees orb for conjunctions and oppositions to other planets. Conjunctions and oppositions are the only aspects that matter, with conjunctions being most important. The following interpretations concern when a fixed star is conjunct a planet in one's chart or an angle or is prominent. The nature of the planet also should be blended in with the nature of the fixed star. Personal planets such as chart ruler/s and angles are important, with the influence of the fixed star being emphasized in both the life affairs and in the personality.

<UL>
