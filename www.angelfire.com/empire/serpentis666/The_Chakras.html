The chakras are the powerful energy 
centers of the soul. Each one has a separate function along with certain 
specific powers. The health of our chakras affects both our physical, emotional, 
and mental health. There are different parts of the soul, the chakras are the 
most important and major part. <BR>There are seven major chakras located along 
the spine that are the most powerful. Each of these chakras vibrates to the 
frequency of the light spectrum. Satanism strongly supports science, as all of 
the spiritual and the occult can be scientifically explained. Both science and 
spirituality complement each other, and work together. Because of the incessant 
attacks and suppression of scientific inquiry and knowledge by the Christian 
Churches, science has been held back dangerously and has not reached a level to 
where all of the occult can be fully explained, but it will in time. The soul is 
made of light. <BR><B><I>"Light is Power" </I><BR>--Lilith</B><BR>
<CENTER><IMG

<P>Six smaller, but equally powerful chakras are located on each side of the 
hips, shoulders, and the temples on the sides of the head. The chakras function 
to empower the soul with energy. These thirteen chakras are essential to life. 
No one can live without them. Because so much ancient knowledge has been 
systematically destroyed and much of what remains has been corrupted, most of 
what is openly available concerning the chakras, unfortunately is flawed. Satan 
and the Powers of Hell reveal spiritual knowledge as we advance ourselves 
through meditation. 
<P>Given the experiences of many, it appears that the three granthis [knots 
where the chakra concerned has a powerful energy block that prevents the serpent 
from ascending] are not at the base, heart, and sixth chakras as popularly 
taught, but are at the second [sacral] chakra, the throat chakra, and the crown 
chakra. There have been many accounts of one's heart chakra feeling a burning 
sensation; as the serpent cannot ascend any further due to a blocked throat 
chakra. 
<P>Now, if the heart chakra were blocked and contained one of the three 
granthis, the burning sensation would manifest in the solar chakra, not the 
heart. Going further, the sensation of the crawlies near the crown chakra 
strongly indicates that chakra is blocked. If it were the 6th chakra as most 
sources of information available inform us, the sensation would be at the throat 
or BENEATH the 6th chakra. From direct experience, it appears that seventh is 
the most difficult chakra to fully open. The sensation of the crawlies, compared 
by some to ants crawling, indicates that the serpentine energy is going *around* 
the seventh chakra and not *through* it as it should when this chakra has been 
fully opened. Other symptoms include pain and discomfort, especially when one's 
serpentine energy is fully activated. 
<P>The crown must be fully opened for the serpent to correctly ascend. Orgasms 
can also be extremely painful, as sexual orgasm opens the chakras and activates 
the serpent. When one is meditating regularly, one's energy is much more 
powerful and this is why these symptoms are very noticeable. 
<P>In many grimoires and ancient texts, the code word for "chakra/s" is "God/s." 
For example, references to certain "words of power" that "command the gods" as 
seen in Ancient Egyptian spiritual writings. "God" is also a code-word for one's 
self. 
<P>The authors of Judeo/Christian Bible perverted and corrupted all spiritual 
knowledge in attempts to systematically remove all of this information from the 
populace. This knowledge has been kept hidden and exploited by a "chosen" few to 
the detriment of humanity. For example, The seven chakras along the spine are 
the "seven seals," written about in the Christian Bible book of "Revelation." 
These are "The seven lamps of fire that burn before the throne of God." The 
ancients left certain codes in the bible. From in-depth research, it strongly 
appears that the bible was written under coercion and threat. The number seven, 
that appears very frequently is a code for the seven chakras. For some more 
information concerning this <A 
href="../../../satanslibrary.org/ExposingChristianity/Destroying_Our_Past.html">click here for the 
article "Destroying Our Past</A> 
<P>
The "Tree of Life" predates Judeo/Christianity by thousands 
      of years. The "Tree of Life" is actually a map of the human soul. The 
      trunk symbolizes the spine and the branches represent the 144, 000 nadis 
      that circulate the chi/witchpower. The fruits are the rewards of 
      meditation; empowering the soul. The serpent seen in the caduceus used 
      both by the American Medical Association and in Veterinary medicine 
      represents the kundalini force. Unfortunately, this most sacred symbol 
      which represents healing at all levels has been heinously blasphemed and 
      corrupted by Judeo/Christianity. <BR>The chakras are referred to as 
      "seals" because the enemy aliens sealed them in humanity to prevent our 
      acquisition of godly power and knowledge. We have been cut off from 
      spirituality and the astral world. Thousands of years ago, we were as the 
      Gods, until the earth was attacked and there was “war in 
heaven.”Our being sealed has caused the human race to 
degenerate. Imbalances in this energy and blockages, along with holes in the 
aura cause drug and alcohol addiction, depression, a lack of concern for the 
feelings of others and other forms of life, abusive behavior and many other 
things that plague humanity. By actively attacking and suppressing sexual 
energy, the all-important serpent is kept trapped within the base chakra, where 
it lies dormant. This is why the Christian Churches condemn sex, to keep 
humanity in darkness, ignorance and spiritual enslavement. By activating and 
opening the second chakra which controls sexuality and creativity, the serpent 
awakens, begins to rise and ascends through the seven major chakras, empowering 
the soul and bringing enlightenment, understanding, and awareness, along with 
many psychic/spiritual gifts and abilities.

    <TD>There are 13 main chakras, with the major seven located and extending 
      along the spine as the most powerful; the shoulder chakras, and the hip 
      and temple chakras supporting these. When activated, the shoulder chakras 
      bolt wings, which give more power to the soul and symbolize spiritual 
      freedom. The temple, hip and shoulder chakras make up the "Pillars" of the 
      "Temple of Solomon." 666 is the Kabalistic square of the Sun. The true 
      meaning of the "Temple of Solomon" is the "TEMPLE OF THE SUN." "Sol" "Om" 
      and "On" are all words for the Sun. "Sol" is the Latin word for the Sun 
      and is close to the English word "soul." </TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<TABLE cellPadding=10>
  <TBODY>

    <TD vAlign=top><IMG src="../../../hailtosatansvictory666.angelfire.com/Hierophant.gif">
    <TD vAlign=top>"Om" is a name given by the Hindus to the Spiritual Sun and 
      "On" is an Egyptian word for Sun. Now, there is another corruption. OHM 
      has replaced the original and ancient vibration for "AUM." Again, this is 
      to remove all power and spiritual knowledge form the populace. Because not 
      everything can be suppressed, what remains in popular mainstream teachings 
      is mostly corrupted. For more information regarding the word of power 
      "AUM" <A href="AUM.html">please click here</A> <BR>The 
      symbol of the chakra trinity- the hip chakras, shoulder and temple chakras 
      can bee seen in the Hierophant card of the Tarot Trump in many decks, 
      symbolized by the scepter in the hand of the Hierophant. </TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The symbolism of the Temple of Solomon is correctly the human soul 
transformed into the godhead, but was stolen and corrupted by the Jews and made 
into another false Jewish character, as with the fictitious nazarene, and nearly 
everything else in the Judeo/Christian Bible. The Sun represents the 
enlightened, transformed, and empowered soul, with "666" being a most sacred and 
important number. 
<P>
<TABLE>

    <TD vAlign=top>A diagram of the human soul can be seen in Astaroth’s Sigil 
      at right. The two bars on each side are the pillars of positive and 
      negative energy on each side of the human soul- the black and white of yin 
      and yang and the checkerboard; the glyph for Venus symbolizes the heart 
      chakra. The five points of Astaroth’s Sigil represent the five elements, 
      fire, earth, air, water, and quintessence invoked into the three knots of 
      the soul; the "granthis." The Tarot, contains very important spiritual 
      information and instructions for opening and empowering the soul. Note 
      As<U>TAROT</U>h which was taken from its Ancient Egyptian origins and 
      hideously corrupted into the Jewish "Torah" or "Pentateuch" and "Five 
      Books of Moses" nonsense. Note how Ashtaroth contains the word Tarot: 
      AshTAROTh. 
    <TD vAlign=top><IMG

      width=130 height=180> </TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>When the human soul is correctly aligned, it is in the shape of an inverted 
cross. This is the hidden meaning of "Thor's Hammer." The cross shape of the 
human soul is represented by "The Four Quarters" The "Four Directions" and the 
Four Crowned Princes of Hell in rituals. 
<UL>
  <LI>The front of the body/soul is the North, ruled by the element of earth. 
  <LI>The rear/backside of the body is the South, ruled by the element of Fire 
  <LI>The left side of the body is the Negative Pole. Through the left hand, we 
  take in energy. The left side is ruled over by the element of water and is the 
  direction west. 
  <LI>The right side is the Positive Pole and is ruled over by the element of 
  air. We direct energy through our right hand. 
  <LI>The element of Quintessence/either is in the center, and in the aura 
  <LI>Fire and Air are electric 
  <LI>Water and Earth are magnetic </LI></UL>
<P>Each of the seven main chakras has a specific function and power. All of the 
chakras, both major and minor directly affect the organs of the body that they 
are in proximity with. This is a reciprocal relationship in regards to one's 
health, as an unhealthy organ will affect the power of the chakra and visa 
versa. The serpent lies coiled at the base of the spine beneath the base chakra 
located at the tailbone. The serpent lies dormant until it is stimulated through 
power meditation or in rare cases, it ascends through accident, being either 
physical injury or other trauma to the area of the tail bone. <BR>Each chakra is 
in the shape of a small funnel, like a miniature spinning tornado in the shape 
of a cup. The suit of cups in the Tarot symbolizes the chakras, as each chakra 
holds energy within its cup. The most important chakra is the solar plexus 
chakra, which is the Grail. There is also more to Thor's Hammer than just its 
symbolizing the correct alignment of the chakras. The vibration 'TH' activates 
the 6th chakra and pineal gland, which is the female counterpart to the solar 
chakra. The pineal gland secretes the elixir of life, which is stored in the 
solar chakra, and the vibration for the solar chakra is 'RA.' This is the hidden 
meaning behind 'THOR' which is another very important spiritual concept. The 
chakras are always spinning unless one wills them to stop as with some methods 
of astral projection.
