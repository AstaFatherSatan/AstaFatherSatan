The world powers have succeeded in creating technology
that can not only read and decipher a person's
thoughts, but can manipulate thoughts as well. After
the second world war, the CIA, NSA, KGB and other
world powers spent billions of dollars for research
on the brain, nervous system, human behavior,
conditioning, control, manipulation and the mind. 
<P>

"In the spring of 1973, Dr. Joseph C. Sharp, at Walter
Reed Army institute of research, "heard" and
understood spoken words communicated to him by "a
pulsed-microwave audiogram (analog of the words' sound
vibrations) beamed into his brain." This device
bypassed the ears and hearing.* 
<P>

"...an experiment in which the human brain received a
message carried to it by a pulsed microwave
transmission." &#185;
<P>

"In its 1996 defense authorization bill, Congress
authorized $37 million for research in what the
Pentagon calls "non-lethal" and "less than lethal"
technologies. This is sold as a "humanitarian" form of
warfare--or crowd control." &#178;
<P>

"RNM [Remote Neural Monitoring] can send encoded
signals to the brain's auditory cortex, thus allowing
audio communications direct to the brain (bypassing
the ears). NSA operatives can use this covertly to
debilitate subjects by simulating auditory
hallucinations characteristic of paranoid
schizophrenia." &#179
<P>

"This modulated information can be put into the brain
at varying intensities from subliminal to
perceptible."<sup>4</sup>
<P>

A "psychosurgeon" can implant electrodes into various
sites in the brains of living creatures and send radio
signals into those electrodes. They call this
"electrically -controlled behavior." Science has
surpassed this with "electronic brain stimulation"
that can do the same without the electrode implants.
"Finely-tuned microwaves can achieve the same results
as implanted electrodes."<sup>5</sup>
<P>

Technology to perceive pre-speech human thought via
skin contact is well developed. Electrical equipment
can gather and read the electrical fields generated on
the skin (the aura) and translate sub-vocal speech
into text. A body can become disabled by sending
disruptive signals into a person's motor cortex;
affecting motor control.
<P>

"To send a thought into a brain, it is necessary to
decode the resonance frequency of each specific brain
area."<sup>6</SUP>
<P>

Science has progressed to where they have deciphered
the brain signals. Like satellite waves can be decoded
onto a TV screen, thought waves can also be deciphered
and read. Of course, this is something kept from the
public. Many unwitting human beings, along with
animals have been experimented upon; implanted with
microchips that control the thought processes and
produce thoughts, feelings, emotions and
hallucinations. 
<P>

Man's attempts to control another's thoughts has been
since the beginning of time. Wars, torture, murder,
interrogation, imprisonment and so on. They now have
the technology to do this. 
<P>

The solution:
Most people out there operate on a certain range of
bio-electricity. When we revamp our bio-electricity to
a much higher level, their attempts at stimulation are
not strong enough to penetrate our aura, because they
are geared for the average person. This is analogous
to immunity and one of the reasons, where magickal and psychic attacks will
rebound upon the sender; when the aura is strong, it
acts as a defense shield, burning off any microscopic
entities that attach themselves before they can do
harm. 
<P>

Black magick is energy. A strong aura is resistant to
negative energy and many times, attacks upon an adept
will rebound against the sender(s). The same as for
the energy sent out to influence the average person.
It isn't strong enough to penetrate a strong aura.    
 <P>


As for their using technology to read our thoughts
through our skin, again, the strength of the aura is
important. Martial artists know how to direct their
bio-electrical "Chi" to smash through concrete and
bricks. Ever think what that kind of energy would do
to one of those sensitive mind reading machines when
strong enough and properly directed?
