 <p><br><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">
For more information, please read through <a href="Returning_Curses.html">RETURNING CURSES PART 1</a>


First off, I want to state here that in addition to us being cursed, there are Wiccan
idiots and others who have sent binding energies to us, especially in regards to
the RTRs, as the RTRs have been actively and effectively destroying the enemy.
<a href="../../../satanslibrary.org/Rtrs/Final_RTR.html">[The Final RTR is the most powerful against them, as that is their bulwark].</a>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">Satan just confirmed to me early this morning what I had already believed; that
HE has power over ALL witches that he said, “connect with our Gods.” In other
words, any practitioners of magick and witchcraft who connect with Pagan Gods
are all under His power. He also stated that a very large percentage of Wiccans
and related are cowards. He said, “They are fearful.” “That’s why they practice
Wicca.”
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">
With so much emphasis on the Moon, as an extremely powerful source of pure
energy, the Sun is often overlooked. I have found the energy of the Sun to be the
most powerful between 11:00 and 14:00 approximately. This is when the Sun is
directly overhead.
<br>When the Sun is rising [waxing on a daily basis], this is another powerful time. An
excellent time for meditation has always been before the Sun rises, before dawn.
The setting [waning] Sun also has some of the same effects as a waning Moon in
removing and ending things. But, ALWAYS take into consideration the Moon, both the sign and the phase. <a href="VOID.html">[make sure the moon is not void of course when you begin this working]</a> Never begin any working during a void of course moon.

</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">The Sun has fire energy, the element of fire, which is the spark of life. When doing a thorough aura
cleaning, stepping outside into the Sun on a sunny day when the Sun is high in
the sky can work wonders. For this to be effective, you must be directly in the
Sun. Just breathe in the solar energies into your aura and soul, engulf yourself in
the solar energy, which is even easier to see astrally when you are sitting, standing or lying in
the brilliance of the Sun. You can even do a <a href="Satanic_Rosary.html">full rosary,</a> vibrating SURYA [Satan
told me 216 times is more effective than 108], and to do this, just reach the last
bead on your rosary and then turn it back. I have worked with this and it is very
effective.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">
You can breathe in energy from the Sun, lighting up your aura with brilliance and
then on each exhale, vibrate SURYA. <br>"SURYA" SUUU-RR-YAH <a href="Surya.mp3">For an audio Mp3 of Surya, please click here</a>


</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">The Ritual:
<br>This working should be repeated every day, if possible.
This will stay on your soul eternally, protecting you, and keeping you safe from
the malice of others; destroying your enemies.

</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">1. Raise your energies. This is best done [as with all magickal workings]
when you are at your most powerful, feeling a strong energy buzz. If you
are new, just do the best you can. You can also use the energy of the Sun [close your eyes, facing the sun, focus on the sun and breathe the energy in], 
as indicated in the above to raise your energies with reciting SURYA,
using a Satanic rosary [or anything that will help you keep count]

</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">2. Clean your aura thoroughly, as instructed from Part 1 of Returning Curses.
DO NOT hesitate to ask for a Demon/ess to help you. Even if you cannot
hear, sense or see the Demon/ess, know He/She is there and is helping
you, and delivering the energies back to the sender/s.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">3. Engulf yourself in the light. Again, I repeat, if at all possible, use the Sun.
Another effective tactic, if you are unable to use the Sun and have trouble
visualizing is to use a lamp, with the bright bulb facing you, shining right in
your face as you close your eyes and visualize the light. 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">Using a desk lamp with a flexible neck, shining in your face is another prop for visualizing the light indoors.  DO NOT USE LED LIGHT BULBS OR LAMPS THAT HAVE LED BUILT INTO THEM!! THESE CAN SEVERELY DAMAGE YOUR EYES, EVEN THOUGH YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED. USE A SOFT WHITE LIGHT BULB, WHICH IS SAFE IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO THIS. NOTE MOST FLASHLIGHTS HAVE THE LED LIGHTING. DO NOT USE THEM!!

</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">4. Affirm 18 times:
“My aura is constantly and continuously deflecting and repelling any and
all negative energies, curses, bindings, hatred, ill will, thoughtforms, and destructive energy
directed at me and is immediately returning these directly right back to the
senders.”

</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">Do this daily. I strongly recommend everyone
do the INTENSE AURA CLEANING indicated in <a href="Returning_Curses.html">RETURNING CURSES PART 1</a>, and keep
repeating this. You will find with deep cleaning your aura, not
only will this remove any curses, but all kinds of other crap that has kept you
down in your personal life. A dirty aura also hinders your workings and personal
powers. The aura and soul have accumulated all kinds of negative energies
throughout many lifetimes and these cannot all be removed in one working. It
must be repeated. AGAIN, I strongly advise you ask Satan to send you a
Demon/ess to work with you in removing these energies. Even if you are new
and cannot see or feel him/her, follow your gut feelings and intuitions. 

</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">It is
extremely important to always say the prayer before your aura cleaning:
<br>Hear me oh Great and Mighty Satan. I ask your help in returning these curses,
amplified to the senders who have attacked us for doing your work. You know
who they are. They will know your wrath. I ask that you send a Demon to me to
take and deliver the curses and thoughtforms that I have cleaned from my aura
and soul directly to those who have sent them. O Mighty Satan, fill me with truth,
wisdom and understanding, keep me strong in my faith and service, that I may
abide always in Thee with Praise, Honor, and Glory be given Thee forever and
ever.
<br>Especially if you are actively working for Satan.
