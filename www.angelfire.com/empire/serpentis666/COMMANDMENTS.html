Satan dictated the Al Jilwah [Black Book of Satan] directly to Yezidi prophet Sheik Adi in the 12th century. The Al Jilwah is the most important doctrine in Satanism and every Satanist should be familiar with its teachings. I asked Satan if the Al Jilwah was from him and he confirmed that it was, and stated that the Muslims altered some of the Yezidi doctrines. I memorized the commandments some time ago, and they have always been of great help and comfort to me especially when I have experienced confusion. 


<P><I>"ALL MY TEACHINGS ARE EASILY APPLICABLE TO ALL TIMES AND ALL CONDITIONS." 
<BR>"I TEACH AND GUIDE THOSE WHO FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTION." 

<P>"I EXERCISE DOMINION OVER ALL CREATURES AND OVER THE AFFAIRS OF ALL WHO ARE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF MY IMAGE. <BR>I AM EVER PRESENT TO HELP ALL WHO TRUST IN ME AND CALL UPON ME IN TIME OF NEED." 

<P>"I ALLOW EVERYONE TO FOLLOW THE DICTATES OF HIS OWN NATURE, BUT HE THAT OPPOSES ME WILL REGRET IT SORELY." 

<P>"NO GOD HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN MY AFFAIRS AND I HAVE MADE IT AN IMPERATIVE RULE THAT EVERYONE SHALL REFRAIN FROM WORSHIPPING ALL GODS."

<P>"WHEN TEMPTATION COMES, I GIVE MY COVENANT TO HIM THAT TRUSTS IN ME." 

<P>"I DO NOT ALLOW FRIENDLY ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE." 

<P>"NOR DO I DEPRIVE THEM THAT ARE MY OWN AND THAT OBEY ME OF ANYTHING THAT IS GOOD FOR THEM." 

<P>"I APPEAR IN DIVERSE MANNERS TO THOSE WHO ARE FAITHFUL AND UNDER MY COMMAND." 

<P>"I LEAD TO THE STRAIGHT PATH WITHOUT A REVEALED BOOK; I DIRECT ARIGHT MY BELOVED AND CHOSEN ONES BY UNSEEN MEANS." 

<P>"THREE THINGS ARE AGAINST ME AND I HATE THREE THINGS." 

<P>"THOSE WHO KEEP MY SECRETS SHALL RECEIVE THE FULFILLMENT OF MY PROMISES." 

<P>"IT IS MY DESIRE THAT ALL MY FOLLOWERS UNITE IN A BOND OF UNITY, LEST THOSE WHO ARE WITHOUT PREVAIL AGAINST THEM."

<P>"REJECT ALL THE TEACHINGS AND SAYINGS OF SUCH AS ARE WITHOUT. I HAVE NOT TAUGHT THESE TEACHINGS, NOR DO THEY PROCEED FROM ME." 

<P>"HONOR MY SYMBOL AND IMAGE, FOR THEY REMIND YOU OF ME."</I>

<P><BR>"I EXERCISE DOMINION OVER ALL CREATURES AND OVER THE AFFAIRS OF ALL WHO ARE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF MY IMAGE. I AM EVER PRESENT TO HELP ALL WHO TRUST IN ME AND CALL UPON ME IN TIME OF NEED."
<br>Satan is always true to his word. Many of us are well aware of how our lives were straightened out after we made a commitment to Satan. He snaps us into line, guides us, and directs us to what we need to do to be focused and happy. When we dedicate our souls to him, we are always under his protection and he is always there for us. Satan has always been there for me. There were times when I was having problems and Father Satan came to me before I even had to ask and helped me out. 
It is very important to trust in Father Satan. He works with every one of us to establish trust. He is honest, truthful, and consistent and he keeps his word. He meets us more than half way. 

<P><BR>"I ALLOW EVERYONE TO FOLLOW THE DICTATES OF HIS OWN NATURE, BUT HE THAT OPPOSES ME WILL REGRET IT SORELY."

<br>Satan wants us all to be happy individuals. We are all free to indulge our fetishes, personal tastes, preferences, and so forth. This is one of the many reasons we are happier than most. 


<P><BR>"NO GOD HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN MY AFFAIRS, AND I HAVE MADE IT AN IMPERATIVE RULE THAT EVERYONE SHALL REFRAIN FROM WORSHIPPING ALL GODS." 

<br>Those who worship other Gods end up confused and are open to all kinds of influences. It is important to stay focused. As Satanists, our God is Satan and there is no need to call upon other gods. Demons act as protectors and direct us to be strong in Satan. They can also act as mediators as they work with us closely, but we do not worship them. Satan does not demand or want any slavish worship. 

<P><BR>"WHEN TEMPTATION COMES, I GIVE MY COVENANT TO HIM THAT TRUSTS IN ME." 

<br>Temptation usually comes in the form of fear. Some, mainly out of fear, have turned to the enemy. The enemy serves no purpose whatsoever in a happy life and should be avoided at all costs. The enemy has also tried to bribe dedicated disciples of Satan or use material rewards. He rewards and places his affairs with those who remain strong and loyal to him. 


<P><BR>"I DO NOT ALLOW FRIENDLY ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE." 

<br>As for associating with those who are without, how many times have we read about or have been direct recipients of problems with Christians alone? Most Christians will try to convert us, especially if they know we are Satanists. Very few if any, will have a live and let live attitude towards a known Satanist. Nearly all will pray for us and this invites psychic harassment that can be more than just annoying. As for hard core Muslims, their practice has been if they cannot convert someone, they resort to murder. Many Yezidis have been murdered en masse by Muslims. In addition, the enemy works through Christians, Muslims and Jews to create upsets and problems for us and this can be serious. 

<P><BR>"NOR DO I DEPRIVE THEM THAT ARE MY OWN AND THAT OBEY ME OF ANYTHING THAT IS GOOD FOR THEM."

<br>Satan knows each and every one of us intimately and what is in our best interests. Satan is our Creator God and he can see things we cannot. He can see if someone or something is bad for us or will do us harm. Trusting in him is very important, he has all of the facts; we don't. He also shows us through power meditation how we can obtain our desires.  

<P><BR>"I APPEAR IN DIVERSE MANNERS TO THOSE WHO ARE FAITHFUL AND UNDER MY COMMAND."

<br>Individuality is very important to Satan and he wants for each of us to grow and develop our own uniqueness. He wants us to be ourselves. All of us are very important to him in our own special way. With Satan, what one individual may experience, another may not and visa-versa. Over all, most of us have had many similar experiences, spiritual occurrences and have seen the same things. 

<P><BR>"I LEAD TO THE STRAIGHT PATH WITHOUT A REVEALED BOOK; I DIRECT ARIGHT MY BELOVED AND CHOSEN ONES BY UNSEEN MEANS."

<br>Satan comes to us. We don't have to spend our lives pouring over reams and reams of reading or other related material, trying to make sense of it, in an attempt to find "God." Satan interacts with every one of us in his own way. He guides each of us and directs us so we can have fulfilling and rewarding lives. 

<P><BR>"THREE THINGS ARE AGAINST ME AND I HATE THREE THINGS."

<br>These three things are the Christian trinity [which is false and a lie] and the three malignant programs of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. All three of these programs condemn and preach against Satan and replace him with their false “God.” These three have told lie upon heinous lie about Satan and his Demons who are the original Gods. They have heaped untold suffering and misery upon humanity and the earth. They are our enemy! 

<P><BR>"THOSE WHO KEEP MY SECRETS SHALL RECEIVE THE FULFILLMENT OF MY PROMISES." 

<br>Because Satan appears to us in diverse ways, he may reveal some of his secrets to us as individuals. We will know what they are. He has done things for me and has revealed things to me. There are certain secrets he has entrusted to me to keep to myself. Remember, Satan treats us all as individuals. Keeping his secrets is very important. If you are ever in doubt concerning whether or not to reveal something, just ask Satan and he will either tell you or you will receive a sign from him. 

<P><BR>"IT IS MY DESIRE THAT ALL MY FOLLOWERS UNITE IN A BOND OF UNITY, LEST THOSE WHO ARE WITHOUT PREVAIL AGAINST THEM." 

<br>Satan wants all of his people to work together and unite. We must put aside our personal differences and work together as a team. The Christian “God” and company work to create conflict, discord, and division among Satanists, as do enemy souls who call themselves “Satanists” but who really aren’t: 

<P>Mark 3: 26 
And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. 

<P>Unity is of paramount importance, “One Alone, Together Strong.” Satan does not approve of infighting between his people. Those who experience conflicts with a brother or sister in Satan should go to Satan concerning this and he will handle the situation. Those who throw curses at or slander other Satanists will invite the wrath of Beelzebub. Beelzebub handles those who create problems and disunity and the consequences can be quite unpleasant. 

<P><BR>"REJECT ALL THE TEACHINGS AND SAYINGS OF SUCH AS ARE WITHOUT. I HAVE NOT TAUGHT THESE TEACHINGS, NOR DO THEY PROCEED FROM ME." 

<br>As for rejecting the teachings and sayings of such as are without, the saying “Garbage in; Garbage out,” describes this perfectly. One only needs to look at the Christians, Muslims, and related company to see how lost and unbalanced they are spiritually. Beneath the Christian smiley mask, there is misery inside, regardless of how they may try to deny it and lie. The teachings of Christians, Jews, Muslims, and those of other related programs are anti-life, devoid of any true spirituality and lead their adherents down the path of spiritual degeneracy, lies, loss, confusion and eventually, depravity. 

<P><BR>"O YEA THAT HAVE BELIEVED IN ME, HONOR MY SYMBOL AND MY IMAGE, FOR THEY REMIND YOU OF ME." 

<br>When I was new to Satanism, I was reading Anton LaVey's Satanic Bible. At the time, I had hardly any furniture and I would line my books up against the wall, on the floor. I did this with my Satanic Bible. Something would not let me go to sleep and kept on nagging at me to get the Satanic Bible up off the floor. I got up and put it on a shelf in my closet. Since then, I purchased several bookcases. We must ALWAYS treat sacred books, jewelry, or anything else that symbolizes Father Satan with the greatest care and respect.
