Ouija Boards are excellent for contacting and having
conversations with Demons and spirits. I prefer to
work the board alone, as another person is a
distraction and prevents any real intimacy with the
spirit contact.

<P>For those of you who are new to this, make sure the
board is on a completely level surface. It is important to enter into a trance when using a Ouija Board.

<BR>Place your fingertips lightly on each side of the
planchette. Soon it will gently begin to pull. Just
relax and let it work. It can take a few minutes to
get going. It is important to be free from distractions and not to be disturbed.

<P>My experience is I sort of go into a trance. Like when
scrying or invoking spirits of the deceased,
everything else in the room is blocked out. My total
focus is on the board. It is sort of like an aura
around all of the edges of the board and my attention
is completely locked in and nothing else outside of
me, exists. This is just my own experience, we are all
individuals, so some of your own experiences may be different.

<P>I am finding more and more, the higher ranking the
Demon, the more energy you will feel. I have a Demon
who is close to me and last night I conversed with
him, using the board. I don't remember how long I was
using the board. This was for quite a while. He asked
me to say something specific out loud. When I did, I
really felt powerful energy light up like a flame
inside of me.

<P>When we have very close contact with or invoke Demons, we
can feel their energy. My skin still feels sensitized,
like with a fever or sunburn, only no pain,
even this morning. Demonic energy is electrifying.
Satan's energy is different, as I'm sure many of you
have experienced during and after rituals. It is calming and
beautiful.

<P>Demons come to us through telepathy and astral projection. It is my
experience that Demons project differently than
humans. With humans, you can see the connecting
strands and when they leave, they snap back out
quickly. Books say the cords connecting the soul to the body are silver colored. The ones I saw with one experience were copper. I have never seen strands with
Demons, but I know the higher ranking ones physically
exist in another world. There are some Demons who can
stay with us at all times, to protect us. These Demons
are lesser as they are in spirit form.

<P>The more you use a Ouija Board, the better you will
become in working it. When we establish a close
relationship with a Demon, all we have to do is tune
into them and they will usually come to us. Demons are to help us spiritually advance. 

<P>Each of us is individual and will have slightly different experiences in using a Ouija board and receiving messages:

<P>1. The automatic method: In this case, the planchette moves automatically, without the
operator knowing what the spirit concerned is going to say. Messages in
foreign languages will also be received, even in languages the operator does not know and has never heard
before. If this happens, it is important to remember and to write the message down on paper. 

<P>2. The inspirational method: This is the most common: here the messages will be given in a sort of thinking aloud inside one's mind. In this case, one practically knows beforehand what the spirit is
about to communicate. By frequent repetition this inspiration will become a passive listening type of communication. One will perceive messages from the one's mind or from outside of the
self. This is sort of like dictation, in that the words come into your mind and then your hands move the planchette. 

<P>3. The intuitive method:  This is where you have the feeling as if you moved the planchette yourself. Any questions will
be answered instantly. The planchette spells out words and sentences in full consciousness, without the operator hearing
anything or being inspired in any way.

<P>The methods also can appear of a mixed kind, for example half automatic and half inspirational or
intuitive and inspirational or all together. Which of the methods will be the dominant one will only be
known after a long period of exercising. Each of the methods is good and reliable, provided you are using
it honestly and candidly. Practice makes perfect!*

<P>One thing I wish to add here. Ouija Boards can be open to anything and everything. It is true that some people have had bad and/or upsetting experiences. Know that not all spirits are friendly or of Satan. If you happen to come into contact with a negative entity, end the Ouija session and do not think of the entity anymore. If you have a Guardian Demon/ess, summon him/her and ask for assistance in getting rid of the negative entity. 

<P>Normally Ouija Boards present no problem and are safe to use. No one should ever fear. In the case of a negative entity, the longer the contact, the more the entity can intrude into your world. Several Joy of Satan members have stated that they always ask any entity if he/she is of Satan. Enemy spirits will not reply back and will usually leave on their own. With performing the dedication to Satan, we have his protection as we advance in power and spiritual knowledge. This includes working with Ouija Boards. As with anything else, the environment in which you are working the board matters.
