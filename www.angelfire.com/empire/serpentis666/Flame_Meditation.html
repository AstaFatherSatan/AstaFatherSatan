Method One:

<P>1. Light a candle and stare at the flame for approximately two minutes. Make sure your attention does not wander. 

<P><TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">2. Close your eyes, place your hands in a relaxed cupped position, palms over your eyes, and concentrate on the imprint of the flame in the darkness. The image will tend to move across your area of vision. Keep looking for it, bring it back and keep concentrating on it for approximately four minutes. <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../../../hailtosatansvictory666.angelfire.com/Cupped_Hands.gif" width="100" height="120">
</TABLE>
<br>3. Relax, empty your thoughts and tune into your breathing for a few minutes, concentrating only on each breath 

<P>What this exercise does: 
<BR>This exercise prepares the mind for one-pointed concentration, which is so important to any psychic/astral workings. With the average person, thoughts are scattered and dissipate into nothing. With a trained mind that can concentrate intensely, one's thoughts are single-pointed, focused like a laser, and have power. Total concentration makes the difference in astral workings. One's will is also developed with this exercise, as a powerful will does not give into distraction. Do not become frustrated or impatient with yourself. It is normal for thoughts to creep in to distract you in the beginning. Total concentration takes time and for most people, is one of the most difficult aspects of training the mind. 


<P><BR>Method Two [intermediate]:

<P>1. Focus on the flame for several minutes

<P>2. Close your eyes and place your hands in a relaxed cupped position, palms over your eyes and concentrate on the imprint of the flame in the darkness. The image will tend to move across your area of vision. 

<P>3. Keeping your eyes closed, bring the flame closer. Move it back and forth. When you are proficient at moving and controlling the flame, try to enter the imprint. You will find the imprint begins to compact and change color. The bright image will change to pink, then to red and grow dark. 

<P>4. Repeat the exercise if you wish.  

<P>What this exercise does: 
<BR>This exercise trains the mind and third eye to direct psychic energy.
