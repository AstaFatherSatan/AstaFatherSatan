Please be aware of the following, especially if you are new:

<P>This entire website is being updated and revised. Some of the information here is very old and outdated, this includes the meditations. Any pages with 2013 at the bottom have been revised and are current. 

<P>Satan gives information as we go along. Not everything is given at once. To summarize the incorrect and outdated information, please be aware of the following:

<UL>
<LI>The correct way to align the soul is in the shape of an inverted cross. This is the true meaning of the inverted cross, also the symbol of "Thor's Hammer." For more information that is current on this, please click here for the full article concerning <A HREF="Chakra_Alignment.html">Chakra Alignment.</a>

<BR><BR><LI>The Solar Plexus Chakra, also known as the "666" chakra; the third chakra, is the Grail of Lucifer and is the most powerful chakra of the soul. The heart chakra is a neuter chakra and is a connector chakra. The heart chakra is NOT the powerhouse of the soul, as is taught from most mainstream sources. 

<BR><BR><LI>Most of the meditations here are much more effective using sound. By "sound" I mean vibrating words of power, along with the visualizations. Visualization alone for many workings is not as near as effective as also using sound. I will be revising and updating the workings that should be using sound. 

<BR><BR><LI>The mudras [hand positions] for opening the soul meditations are totally optional. If your hands are large or you have trouble getting your fingers into the correct positions, this is not important. The sound focused on the chakra you are working with is much more important. The hand positions are only minor. 

<BR><BR><LI>Because everyone is individual and comes here from all kinds of different backgrounds in a spiritual sense, and by this I mean where your soul is presently at from past lives, it is best to begin the chakra activating exercises given as they are; slowly and to take your time. Many have empowered their souls in past lives and when performing some of the exercises given here, in activating the soul, this can be drastic. For those of you who have had little spiritual experiences in your past lives, it may take much longer to achieve spiritual openness, awareness and power. Too much too soon can be a problem, so it is best to take your time, as opening your mind and soul to the astral too quickly can cause serious psychological problems, especially if all of this is very new to you. I will be adding more information and exercises that are extreme in opening the soul, for those of you who are having stubborn blockages and are slow in making progress. 

<BR><BR><LI>The exercises in opening the soul are very simple and easy. When done correctly, these *will* activate and open the chakra they are applied to, but the problem often is that the chakra does not stay open; it closes again, unless it was fully opened in a recent past life. Our Anti-Christ, who is a human who achieved the godhead [both spiritual and physical immortality and perfection], revealed to me that some of the workings, such as opening the smaller chakras of telepathic communication surrounding the sixth and seventh chakras in the head, these vibrations [vibrating the seed mantra of 'TH' must be done thousands of times to fully open them]. A permanent energy uptake must be established and this cannot be done for most people with only one or two meditations. I will be updating this information very soon. 

<BR><BR><LI>Due to centuries of attack on spiritual knowledge and the suppression thereof, much of what is openly taught in mainstream books concerning the chakras and other spiritual information is inaccurate. Again, for the most current information, look to the bottoms of the pages of the articles. If it reads "2013" it is current. 

<BR><BR><LI><A HREF="Yoga2.html">Hatha [physical] yoga</a> is not only for freeing the body so that energy does not become trapped, but the postures are also for opening stubborn blocks on the soul; for example, the inverted asanas, when applied with certain breathing exercises, and following with words of power [specific to the chakra], will open blockages very quickly, but this is advanced and not for people who are new. Not everyone will need this. I will be adding these soon. For example: performing the headstand along with 2-3 rounds of the <A HREF="Breath_of_Fire.html">breath of fire,</a>, then immediately applying the <a href="Bandhas.html">"root lock"</A> and driving the energy to your crown, while holding your breath and on the exhale, vibrating TH, again focusing the vibration on your crown; this will act to drastically open and energize this chakra. This was given to me by Satan, himself.  

<BR><BR><LI>For new people: to begin, you need to activate your soul, and align your chakras <A HREF="OpeningChakras.html">[Click Here for Opening the Chakras]</a>. 
Please make sure you have read and understood everything in the above text on this page. After activating your soul, <A HREF="Basic_Meditation_Program.html">read this article concerning an individualized basic meditation program.</a> Know that as we are all individuals and at different levels of spiritual ability, the effects and results of the meditations given here are not the same for everyone. Start at the beginning level and find out for yourself which meditations are the most effective for you as an individual.

<P>I am working as much as possible on updating all of the Joy of Satan website. This is extensive, as there are many pages that need to be revised. For the most recent updates concerning spiritual knowledge, <A HREF="Groups.html">please visit our e-groups.</a>
