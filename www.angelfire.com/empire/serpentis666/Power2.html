One does not need props or other ritual items to cast a so 
called "spell." The power meditations, done long enough are more than 
effective in one's ability to influence one's environment and others. 
When one's field is strong enough, it is easy to put thoughts, 
feelings and other projections into the minds of others. Some people 
are stronger than others and projecting can be met with some 
resistance, of course depending upon how strong YOU are. The stronger 
ones, though, have their defenses lowered considerable when asleep. 
<P>
Weak people are easy to deal with anywhere and everywhere. Just going 
into a mild trance of focus and concentration and you will notice if 
they are where you can observe these people, the obvious effects of 
your projections. 
<P>
Always remember, it is very important to learn to control anger. When 
one reaches a certain level, offenders, whether they are outsiders or 
loved ones will meet with misfortune. This can be very upsetting when 
a loved one gets into an accident or comes down ill as a result of 
your anger. This comes with power and should be controlled. When 
one's energy field is powerful enough, it does not take much. We must 
always be sure we intend for offenders to get punished. Unintentional 
anger, then the offender apologizes and the hard feelings are gone 
and then the person meets with disaster, this can cause much regret. 
<P>
I cannot overemphasise the power behind these meditations, when done 
long enough and with consistency- every day. 
<P>
For certain specific things, like binding, props can be used as a 
point of focus. Most of the time, just dwelling on something with 
will, focus and desire will make it manifest, provided it is not 
worried about or dwelled on in a doubtful or desperate way.
