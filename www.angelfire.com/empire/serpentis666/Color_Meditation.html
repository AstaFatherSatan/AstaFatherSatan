<body bgcolor="#000000" text="#98AFC7" link="#FF0000" alink="#9e7bff" vlink="#C8B560"> <P><BR><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=3>*This meditation requires the 'breathing' in of energy. You should have experience with the <A HREF="Foundation_Meditation.html">Foundation Meditation</a> before performing this meditation. 

<P>Unfortunately, “white light” is overused by many Wiccan and New Age people 
who don’t know what they are doing. These people use white light to the 
exclusion of all other colors, and as a result are not competent in working with 
colors. Because white contains *all* of the colors of the spectrum, they are taking 
in all of these colors and those they are unable to control or work with, are 
left on their own without direction. Each color represents a particular 
frequency of energy that most of us use in our daily lives. If one is not competent in the 
ability to handle each color, the white light often is unable to be used 
properly. 

<P>White light is easy enough to use and is great for beginners, but the problem is that it is overused. White light is great for cleaning one’s aura and balancing 
energies. It is also great for protection. 

<P>White light, when placed around a 
person, becomes a barrier to interaction with others. This is because white light reflects. If you want to be left 
alone, then envelope yourself in white light. Filling yourself with white light 
on the inside strengthens and protects without becoming a barrier to others if 
you want social interaction. 
<P>Overuse of white light can create an arrogant attitude, especially where 
spirituality is concerned, along with closed mindedness, and rigidity in attitudes. This is often seen in those who practice angel magick. The 
overall result is that of being at a lower level of spiritual development. 

<P>When an individual is competent and has mastered all of the colors, 
he/she is able to use the white light to its fullest extent.

<P>The Color Meditation: 
<P>Begin by getting comfortable and doing breathing 
exercises or whatever you do to focus your mind and calm yourself before 
entering into your trance state. 
<P>Breathe in and fill yourself with each breath with a specific color of the spectrum, visualizing it as brighter and brighter each time (not lighter; by brighter, I mean more intense): <BR> Red, blue, yellow, orange, 
violet, green, indigo (bluish-violet, the color of the 6th chakra) or black. This meditation can also be done after meditating on a specific chakra. You can then fill yourself with the color of that chakra.



<P>If you are new to color meditation, hold the color for two to four minutes. If the color feels pleasant, you can hold for a longer period of time. Those 
who are used to the energy of the colors can hold much longer. One’s increased time 
should be comfortable and gradual. 
<P>Each color should be in its pure form and bright. Later on, it is fine to 
experiment with different shades when adept.  
<P>If a color feel negative to you, work with it gradually. Ask your 
mind for an answer as to why. What does the color mean to you? What associations 
do you have with a particular color? This is a great way to find out more about 
yourself. Which colors feel pleasant to you? These are the ones that you may be 
using the most in your life to the exclusion of others. Knowing this provides 
information as to which chakras need more work to bring them up to full power. 

<P>The most important objective of this meditation is to *feel* the colors. Spend some time with each color, getting into how it feels. Keep a written record in your book of shadows/black book. 

<P>Also, you can meditate on the color outside of yourself to feel its energy. 
It is not necessary to always absorb the color, especially if you feel uncomfortable with certain colors. Remember, if something feels uncomfortable or negative, then stop. When you are 
finished with this meditation, clean your aura with white light as this will act 
to balance the all of the colors in your aura.

<P>The benefits of this meditation are the ability to feel, direct and apply color. Color energy is exceptionally powerful when used in magick. Each color has specific energies and acts to bring results unique to that energy.
