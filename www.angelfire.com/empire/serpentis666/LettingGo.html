I have found in my relationship with Father Satan, it is important to just let go. Satan says in the Black Book, "I exercise dominion over all creatures and over the affairs of all who are under the protection of my image." 
<P>
Having faith can be very trying for many of us. There are those of us who have been abandoned and abused spiritually by the teachings of the enemy, those of us who have been repeatedly screwed over by other human beings, those of us who have witnessed both in seeing it done to others and loved ones, the sorry list goes on and on. It's called reality. Someone was upset with me a while ago and said "You don't trust anyone" I said back "that's why I am still alive." In this world, we can't fully trust others, unfortunately. 
<P>
Father Satan is different; he works with us to heal our psychological wounds and to establish trust. 
I have learned not to worry; just to let go and let Father Satan handle my affairs. He does every time and everything works out for me in a positive way. He has never let me down and has ALWAYS been there for me in my time of need. *
<P>

The same goes for working magick, using our minds and influencing people. When we completely let go and just focus, this is when our workings are most effective and powerful. When we worry, are distracted, or are overly concerned with what we are doing, we defeat ourselves. 
<br>-High Priestess Maxine Dietrich 
<P>
*I wrote this sermon several years ago. Since then I can only say the same. Father Satan has always been there for me, and he is true to his word. He has never let me down. I have never known a more wonderful being. He has turned my life around in a most positive way and he has given me much inner happiness. 

<P>In addition to this, when we worry, we are putting negative and undermining energy, along with doubt into a situation. Negative energy can ruin any working we may be doing. It is extremely difficult for most people to put aside worries, especially in a crisis situation, but with a well-trained mind, it is not so hard. Worry can cloud our judgment and prevent us from thinking rationally, preventing us from solving problems. Once we put our directed energy into something, it is best to let go and try to forget about it so it can work and do  its job.
