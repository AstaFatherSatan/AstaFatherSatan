I have received plenty private e-mails from young
people who live at home with parents or others who
would literally have a stroke if they found out these
kids are Satanists. This article is also for others who need
to keep their beliefs secret. 

<P>Father Satan states in the <a href="Al_Jilwah.html">Black Book</a> we are to keep his
secrets. For those under 18, many of
you are forced to go to church and/or participate in Christian ceremonies. Father Satan understands and knows you are not free because you are under 18. When one is 18 or over age 18, in the USA, one is a legal
adult and this is a different matter. 

<P>For those who are under 18, when forced to go to church, just
concentrate on Father Satan. Don't take part in any of
the prayers. If you are forced to take the communion
host, you can hold it in your mouth, ask to use the
restroom and spit it in the toilet. 
<P>

Read sermons and positive writings about Satan every
day as this will help you in many ways in the face of
oppression. 
<P>

As for those over 18 in the USA, you have the legal
right to do your own thing. You can politely refuse
anything they try to push on you. Once you are 18, you
are acting on your own choice and this is a different
matter. Satanists are strong and unless the
consequences are serious or life threatening, one
should openly refuse. In situations during the
holidays, to keep the peace one can just remain silent
if others insist on praying. You can also pray
silently to Satan.
<P>

Once you become really strong in Satan, Christian symbols,
prayers and related become unbearable and
literally sickening. This is because of a heightened awareness where we can sense all of the negative and destructive energy in them. Christians also feel a sense of extreme unease and even have a horror when being near Satanic symbols, as Satanic and Christian energies are enemies of each other.  

<P>Remember, Christianity is a false religion with a false god. In truth, Christianity is really a program and not a religion, as there is nothing spiritual about it. Once you really know the truth, Christianity will have no power over you.
