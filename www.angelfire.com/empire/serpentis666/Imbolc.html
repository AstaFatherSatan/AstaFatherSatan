So many of our ancient traditions and rites have been destroyed and corrupted. In researching for 

the origins of Candlemas, there were many dead ends and Wiccan rites that made no sense. I 

asked the Demons for help and Father Satan appeared to me for a few seconds and said "Think Fire."

<P>After a bit, it finally occurred to me, this tradition is of fire. "The Feast of Fire." A celebration of 

fire. This holiday has everything to do with the celebration of fire. Fire is an important part of 

Satanism. Imbolc/Candlemas falls midway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. 

Technically, when the sun is at 15 degrees of Aquarius, this holiday should be celebrated.

<P>In ancient times, holidays were celebrated according to the solar and lunar cycles and not according to fixed dates. Celebrating this holiday when the Sun is at 15 degrees of Aquarius gives it a special power as there is a special alignment. The fixed quarters known as the Sabbats, are excellent times for spells and magickal workings, as these will be given an extra boost in manifesting due to the alignment of the sun, especially if they involve the element of fire; e.g. using candle magick or invoking and directing the element of fire. 

<P>In ancient times, People danced around bonfires and celebrated until dawn. Certain foods are traditional for Candlemas/Imbolc, such as crepes and pancakes. Because of their rounded shape and golden color, they are symbolic of the returning sun, which this holiday represents. The emphasis on fire represents the returning warmth of spring and the spark of life/fertility for the coming planting season.

<P>The element of fire is the element of creation and beginnings. Many covens consider this holiday to be significant for initiation rites for new members. This is an excellent time for performing the dedication ritual to Satan.

<BR><BR><LI>Pyromancy [Divination by Fire]
<BR>To use fire to foretell events or divine the future, the intensity of the flames, the shapes they take, the direction the fire may take and/or any images you see in them are ways of practicing pyromancy.
<BR><BR><LI>Bonfires 
<BR><BR><LI>Fire Magick, using the element of fire:
<BR>Fire magick is amplified with invoking and directing the fire element. Fire magick includes: 
<BR>Confidence, fame, success in gambling, pleasure, securing popularity/charisma, increasing health and vitality, healing, protection, success, magickal power, creativity, enthusiasm, energy, stamina, major changes, adaptability, attraction, sudden changes, stimulation, enthusiasm, creativity, energy, gaining control, changing luck and inciting justice. Revenge, anger, pure sexual lust and physical gratification, courage, determination, dealing with enemies. Inciting accidents, fires, injuries. Self confidence, athletics, strength, magickal energy for Black Magick, intensity. Incites lust, energy, strength, sexual energy, dynamism, passionate love, physical desire, courage, will power, athletics [especially competitive]. Good for self empowerment before workings of black magick. When used in black magick, fire as opposed earth is used to bring on sudden attacks, accidents, bloodshed, violence and hatred. Fire can also be used to incite wars, anarchy and cruelty. Properly evoking and directing the fire element will raise the temperature in whatever it is directed to. 


<BR><BR><LI>Fire Meditation: Sit before a fire or lit candle and focus on your goals for the six months. What do you intend to accomplish? What do you feel strongly about? You can write them down in your black book, so that on Lammas [festival of the harvest], you can see evaluate your accomplishments.

<P><span>Covens should celebrate and work as a group on any of the above</span>

<P>The above is mainly a guide; feel free to modify anything and use your creativity as fire is of the creative principle!
