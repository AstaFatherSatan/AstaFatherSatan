Characterizes the beast of burden. Slavish, stupid, slow, domesticated and mild. 
Cowardly. This is the sending rune used in magick. To grow, to wander to destroy 
<BR>Positive aspects; white magick: <BR>Wealth, possessions, honors, property, 
money, expansion. Power over one’s environment, increase in wealth; fertility,

athleticism. It is a rune of courage and boldness, freedom and rebellion. Ur 
represents the horn or the erect phallus, resurrection, life after death. 
Coming, being and passing away. <BR>White Magick: Incites action, sexual 
potency. Freedom. <BR>Black Magick: Used to threaten and destroy. <BR>Magick: 
transfer of energies, used for projecting or drawing in of energy. Repeated use 
of the rune will gradually increase the amounts of energy one can handle at any 
given time. Helps in the growth of one’s own reserves of power. When using Fa 
with another rune, it works to increase the power of any rune it is used with 
for good or ill. Adepts can combine the forces of Fa with the forces of Isa 
(fire and ice), but this could prove disastrous for the uninitiated. Green and 
shimmering gold work well with the energies of this rune.

Beauty” the prick of a thorn, pin or spindle casts a spell upon the victim. The 
bloodstone has been used with this rune in the raising of thunderstorms. 
Hematite used with this rune can shield against electro-magnetic energies and is 
therefore helpful in deflecting curses. Using this rune with a pointed crystal 
focuses energies and projects them. <BR>Black Magick: Brings destruction and 
confusion. Thorr is used in the destruction of enemies and in curses. Used to 
control another or render the individual defenseless. <BR>White Magick: Rune of

changes in the life for good or ill depending on the other runes used in the 
working. Reidh is a solar rune as it also symbolizes the chariot of Amon Ra, the 
Egyptian Sun God and represents the eightfold cycle of the Greater Sabbats. 
Reidh also assists in astral travel. A rune of rhythm and music, Reidh makes one

<BR>Icelandic: Íss <BR>Norwegian: Is 
<P>#11. Isa is a rune of binding. It represents stealth and sneakiness and is used in 
operations where one wishes to proceed undetected; Iss bestows invisibility. In

a rune of binding. <BR>Used in ritual against another, it brings barrenness, 
prevents prosperity, causes depression, and serves as an obstacle to action. Can 
be used to cause paralyzing fear or obsession and to prevent or stop movement,

planting and work in the fields are rewarded with crops. Ar represents the 
cycles of change. Life cycles, lunar cycles, the cycles of the seasons and 
changes. Ar is in contrast to Iss where everything stops. It signifies the 
return of the Sun and brings action. Ar symbolizes a vortex of cycling energy; 
the eight-fold wheel of life, the point inside of the circle, which is the glyph 
for the Sun meaning regeneration. When used in magickal operations, it can bring 
a reversal of personal fortunes. Like the Tarot Card, the Wheel of Fortune, Ar 
can reverse circumstances so misfortune is replaced with luck and visa-versa.
