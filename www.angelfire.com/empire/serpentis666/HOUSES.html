<P><BR><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=3>  

  

THE FIRST HOUSE: 

<br>Angular 
<BR>House of Life 
<BR>The first and most important of the four angles, the first house rules the self and represents the self; one’s body type, one's potential for leadership, the personality, the view of the world, the physical self, one's appearance, the physical health of the body, one's beginnings in life, the self image, outlook, and how one projects oneself. This is the most important house in a natal chart. 


<P>THE SECOND HOUSE: 

<br>Succedent 
<BR>House of Substance 
<BR>Rules: Money, material possessions, material desires, material and financial gain, or loss of income, and the earning and spending capacities. The second house also reveals one's material values, how one spends his/her money, and how one attracts money.   


<P>THE THIRD HOUSE: 

<br>Cadent 
<BR>House of Relationships 
<BR>Rules: Brothers, sisters, relatives, neighbors, communications, early schooling, short distance travel, the immediate environment/neighborhood, automobiles, buses, trains, the ability to learn, radios, TVs, newspapers, thinking, the manner in which one communicates, physical actions, skills, speech and the eyesight, hearing and manual dexterity.  


<P>THE FOURTH HOUSE: 

<br>Angular 
<BR>House of Endings 
<BR>Rules: The home, the mother, the family, one's early childhood, the conditions in old age, all things domestic, and one's psychological foundations. The fourth house rules the place of birth, one's domestic property, real estate, land, the underground, mines, and other subterranean places. 


<P>THE FIFTH HOUSE: 

<br>Succedent 
<BR>House of Life 
<BR>Rules: One's children, one's first child [the second child is ruled by the 7th house, the third by the 9th, the fourth by the 11th and so on, each skipping a house], how one has fun, athletes, athletics, acting, recreation, love affairs, theatres, gambling, risk taking, games and sports, and one's creative potential. The fifth house also rules one's pets.


<P>THE SIXTH HOUSE: 

<br>Cadent 
<BR>House of Substance 
<BR>Rules: The health, day to day work and service, what you give, small animals, cleanliness, hygiene, food preferences, people who are under your supervision at work and your attitude towards them, clothing, servants, climate/weather and its affect on your health, routine responsibilities and daily tasks, and one's type of work.


<P>THE SEVENTH HOUSE: 

<br>Angular 
<BR>House of Relationships 
<BR>Rules: The marriage/significant partner, the second child, other people in your life, the law, lawsuits, how others treat you, the people you attract as partners, contracts, agreements, open enemies, rivals, the grandparents on the mother's side, business partners, what one attracts in regards to a partner, and one's interactions with people in general. 


<P>THE EIGHTH HOUSE: 

<br>Succedent 
<BR>House of endings 
<BR>Rules: Sex, death, taxes, inheritances, money one owes, the partner's finances, what one receives from others, the kind of death one will have, deep soul mate contacts, changes brought about by a major crisis, legacies and wills, how one evolves through suffering. The eighth is the house of the occult, the spiritual and is a house of power. 

<P>*Planets in the eighth, if they are ruling any of the houses of relationships, the people ruled by the house, may die. For example- Sagittarius on the cusp of the third [house of siblings]; with Jupiter in the eighth; a brother or sister may die prematurely. This is only a possibility. The eighth house is also the house of extreme power. If one's marriage ruler is placed in the eighth [ruler of the 7th in the 8th], the partner may be exceptionally important and powerful. Eva Braun, who married Adolf Hitler, had the ruler of her marriage house in the 8th house. 

<P>THE NINTH HOUSE: 

<br>Cadent 
<BR>House of Life 
<BR>Rules: One's second spouse, one's third child, one's in-laws, and one's religious and spiritual beliefs, long distance travel, universities and higher education, one's grandchildren, one's writing potential. The ninth house rules publishing, foreign countries and cultures, people of other races, foreigner peoples, anything international, advanced training, law suits (along with the 7th house), legal decisions, judges, and one's overall beliefs and philosophies. 


<P>THE TENTH HOUSE: 

<br>Cardinal 
<BR>House of Substance 
<BR>Rules: The Career, fame, public standing, one's father, one's reputation, one's rank, people who are in positions of power such as one's bosses, and the government, along with one's attitude towards authority figures. 


<P>THE ELEVENTH HOUSE: 

<br>Succedent 
<BR>House of Relationships 
<BR>Rules: Friends, groups, goals, associations, organizations, hopes and wishes, social activities, the third spouse, and step children. 


<P>THE TWELFTH HOUSE: 

<br>Cadent 
<BR>House of Endings 
<BR>The 12th house is the house of sorrow. In a positive sense, it is the house of psychic ability. It rules and represents the psyche, the unconscious, secret enemies, self-undoing, secrets, and skeletons in the closet. The twelfth is the house of confinement, illness, seclusion, institutions, hospitals, large animals, one's innermost secrets and emotions. It rules imprisonment, and prisons. The twelfth is the house of secrets. 

<P>Planets in the 12th, the affairs of the houses they rule are subject to misfortune. Victimization, resentment, loss, disappointment, and misfortune can occur regarding the affairs of the houses that have their rulers placed in the twelfth house. The 12th is a powerhouse of psychic ability and energy, when properly sublimated.
