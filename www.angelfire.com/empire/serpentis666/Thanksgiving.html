There are many times we are blessed by Satan. It is very important that we show our gratitude and acknowledge his gifts. For a Thanksgiving Ritual, this is a way to show appreciation, but the best way is to do some actual work for the Powers of Hell. When one is new, the Powers of Hell will often work on your behalf and help you. The entire foundation of True Satanism is that Satan helps us and gives us the knowledge to where we can become independent and to help ourselves. Whenever one petitions the Powers of Hell, one draws off of their energies. The entire focus here is one should be sing one’s own energies as soon as one is able to. 
<P>
Giving a Demon/ess something in return; if one is not yet spiritually powerful enough and needs assistance from a Demon/ess, “something in return” means actually working for the advancement of Satanism. Working against the enemies of Satan, such as noted in the Hell’s Army website - Click Here 
<P>
Work to destroy the enemy and do this effectively. Educate people to the truth, but do this safely and safely is effectively. This can be done online, where you can reach thousands. Working offline,you can put anti-Christian tracts in bibles, Christian books in libraries and such; wherever they will be seen and read. The enemy leaves Christian tracts all over the place and consistently. Be discreet, work quietly and counter them. Practical work is what the Powers of Hell need from us, not just verbal gibberish- talking the talk, but doing little or nothing to actually show appreciation and thanks. Talk is cheap, whether it is used in ritual or otherwise. SHOW your appreciation by devoting your time and energy when and where you can to destroy the enemy and to advance Satanism. 
<P>
Lastly- one of the most important things you can give the Powers of Hell is your energy. If you have energy to spare, ask for Satan to send a Demon/ess to take the energy and to deliver it where the Powers of Hell need it. This also includes if you are ever overcharged with energy. Establish a relationship with a Demon/ess and call upon him/her to take any excess energy and deliver it to the Powers of Hell. This is even more serious if you have a coven. Your Patron Demon/ess can take any energy that is left over and deliver it. This is a very important gesture of gratitude. 
<P>
Satan wants our efforts and our work, for we are at war; not idle chit-chat or meaningless talk. Everyone should know what to “give a Demon in return.” Offer your services and hard work, NOT trinkets, food, or other worthless junk. Work where you are able to, build your powers through consistent meditation, and strive for independence to where you can make your own desires manifest in reality on your own. If you are in doubt concerning what to do or how to work, focus on Satan and ask him in your mind. Be aware and open, and you will receive signs.
