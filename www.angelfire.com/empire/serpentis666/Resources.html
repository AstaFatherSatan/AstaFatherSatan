<P><h1>KNOW YOUR RIGHTS:</h1>

<P><font size="4"><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/vii.html">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> makes it illegal for any employer to discrimminate against an individual on the basis of his/her religion. It is important for everyone of us to know the law and our legal rights concerning our beliefs. 
</p>

<P>Here are some important tips and guidelines to follow that pertain to Spiritual Satanists:
</p><P>1. If you ever find yourself incarcrated (in jail) ANYWHERE,
keep your beliefs to yourself. The authorities in
these places, like it or not, DO have it over on you
and can do as they please with you for as long as you
remain in custody.</p>


<P> 2. In these places, a counselor or psychologist will
more than likely interview you. Keep it simple. Sound
as though you are a sheep and conform. These
individuals do not and will not recognize psychic
phenomena, spirituality (unless it is moderate and
MAINSTREAM, ie, xianity, judaism, islam). </table><P><font size="4">Most are
trained as atheists or are xtians and openly discussing your
beliefs, practices or gifted abilities will result in
a full psychiatric evaluation.
</p><P>
3. Coming to the attention of a psychiatrist M.D.,
will result in being labeled as insane, given
psychiatric drugs against your will (they can put them in
your food) and you will be sent to a
psychiatric ward, to be incarcerated there. Any little
thing you do or say there will label you insane,
unless you act as though you completely conform.   
</P><P>
4. As for black magick, the burning days are over. The
authority labels this sort of thing as bunk, on the lunatic fringe and does not recognize
such phenomena. BUT, DO NOT make threats to anyone. Making threats of any kind IS illegal. If
you wish to place a curse on someone, keep this to yourself and
DO IT, don't talk or brag about it BEFOREHAND, as they
can get you on MAKING THREATS, HARASSMENT and
INTIMIDATION. When the damage is done, they can't do a
fucking thing.
</p><P>
CONCERNING EMPLOYMENT:
<BR>Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, employers in the US are prohibited from from
discriminating against individuals because of their
religion in hiring, firing, and other terms and
conditions of employment.  
<BR>It also requires employers to reasonably accommodate
the religious practices of an employee, unless to do
so would create an undue hardship on the employer. 
You have the right to practice your religion to the same
level as everyone else in your workplace.</p> 

<P>Everyone should ask his/her
Human Resources personnel or other representatives for
a copy of your employers policy regarding religion in
the workplace. There are many places who do not have this, but in places that do, this is a major help. Read it thoroughly and keep it in a safe place at home. </p>  

<P>Basic Rights include:
<BR>
Holiday Observances - unless an employer can prove
that it will cause undue hardship, they must allow
observances of religious holidays. 
</P><P>
 Employers are also restricted from inquiring about an
employee's future availability at certain times.
</P><P>
Dress Code - employers may not maintain a restrictive
dress code in direct conflict with an employee's
religious obligations.
</P><P>
Discrimination - it is illegal for an employer to fire
or refuse to hire an employee based solely on their
religion.  It is also illegal for employees to be
passed over for promotion, excluded from special
training programs, or demoted for religious reasons.
</P><P>

In 1997, Pres. Clinton issued guidelines for federal
employees (government workers) regarding religion in the workplace. 
<BR>Although they are only applicable to federal workers,
these guidelines have been used by many business as a
framework for their own religious policies.
</p><P>
  The guidelines include: 
<BR>Expression in Private Work Areas - Religious
expressions in areas not open to the public are
respected in the same way that non religious
expressions are allowed.  Specifically, members are
allowed to have religious literature at their desks
and include religious icons or posters in their work
area.*
<BR>*Now this is for federal employees in the USA and may not apply to most private industry jobs. 
</P><P>
Expression Among Fellow Employees: 
<BR>
Employees are entitled to discuss their religious
views privately, as long as those views are not
harassing to fellow workers.  They are also entitled
to display religious messages on clothing, an wear
religious medallions or jewelry outside of their
clothing.
</p><P>
Coercion of Employees - a supervisor is not permitted
to use his or her position of authority to coerce
employees to change their behavior regarding religion.
</P><P>
  Supervisors are not allowed to require employee
attendance at religious events or use religious
factors to determine an employee's status in the
company.
</P><P>
Harassment - employees are protected from the use of
repeated derogatory or inflammatory comments about
their religion, whether by supervisors or fellow
employees.  This includes repeated harassment or
unwelcome proselytization, exclusion of the employee
from work groups, or repeated verbal attacks.
</P><P>
Unfortunately, harassment and discrimination do exist
in the workplace despite the guidelines and laws
passed in the USA.  
</p><P>
PROTECT YOURSELF FROM HARASSMENT:
</p<P>
According to a 1997 survey, the most common religion
related problems in US workplaces were proselytizing
and religious harassment.  No one should be forced to
contend with a hostile work environment, yet many of
alternative faiths 'take it' daily, fearing reprisals
or firing should they speak up. 
 </P><P> 
 By taking a few precautions, you can excercise your
rights to religious expression without fear of
reprisal from supervisors or coworkers.  
</P><P>
   
Your EO Officer -
</P><P>
 Most larger firms employ an Equal Opportunity
Officer.  This person is in charge of making sure that
the company complies with all of the EEOC guidelines
and regulations.  If you practice a minority religion,
or one that is often misunderstood by the general
public, make sure that your EO officer understands the
facts about your faith BEFORE any problems arise.
</P><P>
"Good Employee" - the most common ruse to rid a
workplace of an unwanted employee is "poor
performance".  Make sure that you're prepared! 
</P><P>
 If you receive notes or post-it notes commending your
work, keep them in a file with the date and nature of
the work.  Keep your awards and commendations, along
with dates.  Keep these at home and in a safe place. If you are fired for poor performance,
your file will be invaluable in proving your case.
</p><P>
Pocket Journal - if someone makes a rude or derogatory
comment about your faith, write it down in a small
notebook, along with the date, time, place, and any
witnesses to the conversation.  Not only will it
discourage harassment, but you will also have a record
of repeated offenses should you ever need to complain
to your superiors. Keep a backup copy at home in a safe place. 
</P><P>
Religious expression in the office is
a balance between faith and business.  Don't attempt
to make your work area into a "temple away from
home". <U> Use coworkers examples and office policy to
determine what you should, or shouldn't, place on your
desk and walls.</U> 
<P>Don't Apologize - you have the right to your beliefs.

 </P><P> If someone starts a religious discussion that you
don't like, tell them politely that you aren't
interested.  Xtains stating they will "pray" for you is harrassment and intimidation in legal terms on the job. If they persist, inform them of your
civil rights and refer them to the EEOC guidelines on
religion in the workplace.  If that doesn't work,
report them to a superior.
Remember to keep a record of all of the details- names of everyone concerned, date, time, place, etc.

<P>

Sometimes, even the strongest warnings and complaints
have little or no effect on discrimination.  In that
case, <A HREF="https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/howtofil.htmlhttps://www.eeoc.gov/facts/howtofil.html">you may need to report your employer to the U.S.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) LINK</a> the
government agency charged with protecting your civil
rights. 
</p><P>
<font color="ff0000">Charges of discrimination based on religion MUST be
filed within 180 days of the incident.</font><font color="000000">  Charges may be
filed in person, by mail or by telephone by contacting
the nearest EEOC office. If there is not an EEOC
office in the immediate area, call toll free
800-669-4000 or 800-669-6820 (TDD) for more
information.

<P><font size="5">RIGHTS FOR KIDS AND TEENS ATTENDING PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE USA:
</p>
<P><font size="4">For those of you who attend public schools in the USA, the constitution protects you and enforces seperation of church and state.</p>

<P>Many schools, especially in the area known as the "bible belt" will try any way they can to get around these laws. It is important to keep a record, same as adults who are facing discrimmination in the workplace.</p>

<P>The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that everyone in the United States has the right to practice his or her own religion, or no religion at all.</p>

<P>It is important to know your rights. People who violate these rights are breaking the law and are subject to disciplinary measures same as anyone else. It is important not to just let it go, or look the other way. If everyone ignored violations of their civil rights, no one would be free. </p>

<P>Xtians are notorious for coercing their religious beliefs upon kids and teens; using fear, bribes and all kinds of other unethical tactics to snare young minds. In a public school setting, THIS IS ILLEGAL!!</p>

<P> IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO TEACH RELIGION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
<BR>Public schools are run by the government and funded by the tax payers. They must obey the First Amendment. This means that while they can teach ABOUT the influences of religion in history, literature and philosophy, BUT, they can't PROMOTE religious beliefs or practices as part of the school curriculum. Since private and parochial schools aren't run by the government, the First Amendment doesn't apply to them.
</P><P>
Students have the legal right to be excused from some school activities if they conflict with their religious beliefs.</p>

<P>A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER IS FORBIDDEN FROM STARTING THE DAY OR A MEETING WITH PRAYER
<BR>Any prayers, scriptural readings and loudspeaker devotionals violate the First Amendment because they PROMOTE RELIGION. This is true even if the prayer is "non-denominational" (not of any particular religion.) Moments of silence might be unconstitutional -- it depends on whether or not the real reason they're being held is to encourage prayer. STUDENT LED PRAYER IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS WELL.</p>

<p> Individual students have the right to pray whenever they want to, as long as they don't disrupt classroom instruction or other educational activities; or try to force others to pray along with them. If a school official has told you that you can't pray at all during the school day, your right to exercise your religion is being violated. </p>

<P>If you feel your rights are being violated, the first step is to discuss this with a school counselor or principal. If there are more than one of you, there is strength in numbers and you should all go together. If nothing is done or the person in authority tries to soft soap, aviod or make excuses for the issue, warn them you will take this to a higher level if something is not done immediately. The school board, district, ACLU...</p>

<P>Most public schools provide a handbook at the beginning of the year for their attending students and it is important to read this and use it if necessary. </p>

<P>Unfortunately, most people believe what they are told concerning Satanic practices from our enemies. Inform your superiors that you are law abiding and know your legal rights and should receive the same level of respect as anyone else. Anything less is discrimination. </p>
