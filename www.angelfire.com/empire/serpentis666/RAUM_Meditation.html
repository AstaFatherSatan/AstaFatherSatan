This meditation is about the most 
powerful I have ever done. Special thanks to our Anti-christ who gave me this 
meditation telepathically. He is one of the very few who has completed the 
magnum opus. 
<p>This meditation is exceptionally powerful and should only be performed by 
experienced meditators. 
<p><br>Vibrate RAUM 
<ul>
  <li>RRR into your base chakra [be sure to roll the R's] 
  <li>AHH into your sacral chakra 
  <li>UUU into your solar plexus chakra 
  <li>MMM into your heart chakra 
  <li>Now, vibrate RRR into your heart chakra [be sure to roll the R's] 
  <li>AAAH into your throat chakra 
  <li>UUU into your 6th chakra 
  <li>MMM into your crown chakra. </li></ul>
<p>The above is one round. Do several rounds. It is best to do 13 rounds, or a 
multiple of 13. 
<p>Following the completion of the above, vibrate I-O. I is the symbol for the 
masculine side of the soul [representing the penis] and O is the symbol for the 
feminine side of the soul [representing the vagina]. This is especially seen in 
the Sigils of our Gods. This is also taken from the Greek legend of IO, Princess 
of Argos, which is an allegory. Argos is of Agares. 
<p>Vibrate EEEE focusing on the right side of your body and immediately follow 
by vibrating OOOOH focusing on the left side of your body [going back and 
forth], 40 times. 
<p>For example, vibrate EEEE focusing on the right side of your body [torso], 
then immediately vibrate OOOH focusing on the left side of your body. That is 
one round. Then, immediately vibrate EEEE on the right, then immediately vibrate 
OOOH on the left. That is the second round. Do 40 rounds of vibrating I then O 
using a <a href="Satanic_Rosary.html">Satanic 
rosary.</a> A Satanic rosary is used so one is not distracted when vibrating 
high numbers of repetitions, by trying to keep count. 
<p>The I vibration, pronounced as EEE, is pronounced as the long American 
English E, as in the American English words SEE, TEA, and ME. 
<p>The OOOH vibration is the American English long O, such as in the words HOLD, 
and NO. 
<p>Following the completion of the above, vibrate E-A. Vibrate E, pronounced AY, 
as in the American English words MAY, SAY, DAY; focusing on the front of your 
body, and then AHHHH, focusing on your entire spine. 
<p>For example, vibrate AAAAYYYYY, focusing on the front of your body- just your 
torso, then immediately vibrate AAAH focusing on your entire spine. That is one 
round. Then, immediately vibrate AAYYY on focusing on the front of your body, 
then immediately vibrate AAAH focusing on your entire spine. That is the second 
round. Do 40 rounds of vibrating E then A using a Satanic rosary. 
<p>The so-called “tetragrammaton” is actually the four-fold meditation for the 
soul. The “sacred name of God” is a code word for the extreme word of power for 
the soul. “God” is a code word for the self. The enemy has seriously corrupted 
this. For more information regarding this, <a href="../../../satanslibrary.org/ExposingChristianity/Tetragrammaton.html">click here for the article "The 
Real Tetragrammaton: Further Exposing Christianity"</a> 
<p>This meditation empowers the entire soul. The heart chakra is a connector and 
energy vibrated into it from below will then connect to and transfer into the 
upper chakras in the second part of the meditation. Just be aware, this is 
exceptionally powerful and you will definitely feel it the very first time. 
<p>This is a powerful meditation to use both before a formal ritual or any 
informal working. This meditation can be performed several times a day to 
empower the soul. It is a primer. Following this, one may vibrate a short mantra 
or a word of power as in <a href="Satans_Squares.html">Satan's Squares,</a> such as 
SURYAE. Vibrating the word alone SUUU-RR-YAH-YAY, nine times, or a multiple of 
nine is effective. You do not need to vibrate all of the Sun mantra given in the 
squares. Following this, you may want to state an affirmation, directing the 
energy into a specific goal, several times.
