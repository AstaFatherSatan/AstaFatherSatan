In order to really become adept, one must master the elements. This is also the message of the Mage card of the Tarot. You must be healthy to invoke the elements. For those of you who wish to go slowly, these preliminary meditations can help:

<P><BR>For Fire:

<P>1. Sit quietly and relax. 

<P>2. Visualize a large bonfire. *Hear* the crackling and *feel* the heat, then *smell* the heat. 
<BR>Do this for five minutes. 

<P><BR>For Water:

<P>1. Sit quietly and relax. 

<P>2. Visualize yourself wading in water. This can be a lake, the river or the ocean. *Feel* the water, *hear* the water and *smell* the water, like you are actually there. 
<BR>Do this for five minutes. 

<P><BR>For Earth:

<P>1. Sit quietly and relax. 

<P>2. Visualize yourself walking barefoot on the earth. This is best if you can visulize yourself walking on soil in a farm field as this is very close to the element of earth. *Feel* the soil under your bare feet and *hear* and *feel* the light breeze through the air and *smell* the earth. 
<BR>Do this for five minutes. 

<P><BR>For Air:

<P>1. Sit quietly and relax. 

<P>2. Visualize yourself walking against the wind. *Feel* the wind blow against your skin and the roar of the wind in your ears. *Smell* the fresh air as it blows against you. Feel each step walking into the wind. 
<BR>Do this for five minutes. 


<P><BR>Next Step for Fire:

<P>1. Sit quietly and relax. 

<P>Visualize yourself walking throuigh the desert. *Feel* the searing heat and the dry hot wind in the scorching environment. Feel the sand beneath your feet and your body growing hotter. 
<BR>Do this exercise for three to four minutes and no longer. 



<P><BR>Next Step for Water:

<P>1. Sit quietly and relax. 

<P>Visualize yourself in a cold environment. Feel yourself getting cold. Feel the cold wind blow on your skin. For those of you who know snow (some brothers and sisters live in tropical environments, so not everyone has experienced snow), visualize yourself in snow and ice. Hear the crunching of the snow beneath your feet. For those of you who have never experienced snow- just visualize yourself in a cold environment and use all of your astral senses. 
<BR>Do this exercise for three to four minutes and no longer. 

 

<P>What the above exercises do: 
<BR>In addition to strengthening your astral senses, these exercises will introduce you to working with the four elements of earth, air, fire and water. By invoking these elements, we can strengthen ourselves to where we will be able to withstand incredible amounts of heat, cold and other extremes. Invoking and directing fire is a very important aspect of pyrokinesis. With invoking the fire element, we can keep warm or with the water element, cool if circumstances call for this. Invocation of fire is how the Tibetan monks spent the nights of their initiation in the ice cold mountains, naked under in a wet sheet in a snow storm. In the morning, if the initiate passed, the sheet was warm and dry and the snow and ice were melted in the surrounding area. 

<P>Some 1920's-30's Satanic Lodges in Germany used the element of fire for assassination. The element when invoked and directed to the victim would make the victim's blood literally boil. 

<P>The air element, when invoked properly, produces levitation. Through invocation and proper direction of the elements, we can also influence the weather. 

<P>The foundation of advanced magick is through the control of the elements, this includes healing and all aspects of magick, white, black and grey.
