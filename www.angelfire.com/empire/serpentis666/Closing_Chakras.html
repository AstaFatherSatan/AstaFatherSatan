This exercise is important and very useful for shutting out unwanted and/or harmful energies. Upon closing your chakras, you will feel a sense of calm and inner peace. Closing your chakras will also protect you from the energies of both unpleasant humans and astral entities as both attach themselves, penetrating at the chakras. By closing your chakras when you are in the presence of threatening beings, you can prevent most of the negative energies from entering and attaching to your soul. Closed chakras can also protect you from psychic vampirism. This exercise can also help to still the mind when done before void meditation as it shuts out a lot of psychic noise. 
<P>
1. Begin at the base chakra. Visualize your base chakra as a whirling red vortex of energy, point facing upwards like a pyramid. Visualize either doors or shuttered doors and close them on the chakra, shutting out all of the light. You can visualize this from the front of the chakra, like looking at the chakra through a window. 
<P>
2. Continue this with each individual chakra, all the way up to your crown chakra. 
<P>
You should feel a sense of peace and quiet when all of your chakras are closed. This exercise can be done several times a day if you wish to block out unwanted external stimuli and/or to protect yourself in a negative environment like around Christians or other undesirables. 
<P>
This is especially effective for people who are natural mediums and empaths, who easily absorb energy from those around them and their environments. This exercise is also a help for those who are easily distracted by external stimuli. 
<P>
This is another exercise that is necessary to master, as it is used in an advanced stage of the <A HREF="Magnum_Opus.html">Magnum Opus.</a>
<P>
Your chakras will open back up on their own after a bit. If you feel you need to open them right away, just reverse the above exercise, open the doors, and spin each chakra several times.
