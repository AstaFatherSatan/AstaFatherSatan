It is important to <a href="Hypnosis.html">read all of the articles in the hypnosis section</a> so you know what you are doing before hypnotizing another person. 
In order to effectively hypnotize another person, that person must be completely and deeply relaxed. The person should be sitting comfortably in a reclined position. When lying down, the subject is likely to fall asleep. 
        
<P>You must stay calm and in control at all times. 

<P>Begin by talking the subject through total body relaxation. Start at the feet, have the subject tense them up and relax them; then the ankles, the calves, knees and so on, working your way to the subjects face and head.

<P>When the subject is fully relaxed, tell him/her to remember a happy event that took place in their past. Ask him/her questions about it, where it took place, who was there, how he/she felt, what was in the room or area the event took place and so forth. This is done to activate the intuitive right side of the subject’s brain and the subconscious mind of memory.

<P>When you are finished with the above, tell the subject you are going to count backwards. With each number, he/she will become more and more relaxed: 
<UL>
<LI>“Ten; &nbsp;&nbsp;you are becoming more and more relaxed than before.”

<BR><BR><LI>“Nine; &nbsp;&nbsp;you are drifting down deeper and deeper into total relaxation”

<BR><BR><LI>“Eight; &nbsp;&nbsp;your body is totally relaxed; you can barely feel your body.

<BR><BR><LI>“Seven; &nbsp;&nbsp;you are completely relaxed and feel very peaceful”

<BR><BR><LI>“Six; &nbsp;&nbsp;with each breath, you are relaxing more and more with each exhalation.”

<BR><BR><LI>“Five; &nbsp;&nbsp;we are going all the way down into the deepest level of relaxation.”

<BR><BR><LI>“Four; &nbsp;&nbsp;relax… three, two, one</ul>
 
<P>You want to <a href="Determining_Trance.html"> determine the depth of the trance</a> at this stage. If the subject is new to hypnosis, more sessions are usually needed before he/she is able to enter a deep trance. To deepen the trance:

<UL>
<LI>“Ten; &nbsp;&nbsp;you are becoming more and more relaxed than before.”

<BR><BR><LI>“Nine; &nbsp;&nbsp;you are drifting down deeper and deeper into total relaxation”

<BR><BR><LI>“Eight; &nbsp;&nbsp;your body is totally relaxed; you can barely feel your body.

<BR><BR><LI>“Seven; &nbsp;&nbsp;you are completely relaxed and feel very peaceful”

<BR><BR><LI>“Six; &nbsp;&nbsp;with each breath, you are relaxing more and more with each exhalation.”

<BR><BR><LI>“Five; &nbsp;&nbsp;we are going all the way down into the deepest level of relaxation.”

<BR><BR><LI>“Four; &nbsp;&nbsp;relax… three, two, one</ul>

<P>Again, you want to <a href="Determining_Trance.html"> determine the depth of the trance</a> at this stage. If the subject is new to hypnosis, more sessions are usually needed before he/she is able to enter a deep trance. Repeat the steps directly above this paragraph if the subject is still not at the desired level of trance. 

<P>Here is where you will program the subject’s mind. Make short to the point statements that deal with a specific area or problem. Only work on one problem per session and make sure the problem is resolved before moving onto another. Make all statements to be in the present tense. "Will" never comes and the mind does not understand the future tense.

 <P>FOR PAST LIFE REGRESSION:

<P>Put the subject into a deep trance and say:
<BR> “I am going to count backward from 10-1.” <BR>"With each number, you will enter a deeper and deeper state of relaxation."<BR> “When I reach one, you will be standing in front of a door.” 
<p>Slowly count backwards. 
<p>“You are standing in front of a closed door. I am going to count backwards from ten to one and when I reach one,  I want you to turn the knob and open the door." “....3, 2, 1." 

<BR>Now ask the subject if he/she opened the door. If not, he/she is not deep enough into the trance for this session to be effective. Either put him/her further under or bring him/her out of the trance and end the session. 
<BR>If he/she opened the door, then say:
<BR> "I now want you to walk through the door. You are now in a previous life.” “Look around you, what do you see?” “What is the current date” “Who are you?” 

<P>Continue talking him/her through the experience

<P>When you are ready to bring the person out- “I am going to count from one to five.” “At the count of five, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, alert and feeling fine.” “1…2…3…4…5” "Open your eyes."</p>

<P>If you wish to do a mind wipe, where the subject will not remember anything from the session, be sure to tell them at the end of the session “When you awaken, you will remember nothing of this session.” “Your last memory will be coming through the door.” (Whatever happened before the session). 
<P>With professional hypnosis, a mind wipe is often necessary of the subject experiences trauma during a regression.   


<P>EXAMPLES:


<P>Attracting wealth-</P>

<P>“You are attracting more and more money.” “Your life is filled with wealth and you have everything you want.”  (Similar statements for money)</p>

 

<P>For Healing: 

<P>Have the subject to visualize a bright ball of light like the Sun. Tell him/her to visualize this light on the afflicted body part. "The light is healing energy, that is healing your______________. 

<P>Say to the subject: “Visualize a ball of bright light, like the Sun. Do you see the ball of light?"</p>

<P>The subject should answer, “Yes.”</p>


<P>“I want you to place the ball of light on your (name of body part).”</p>

<P>“Completely surround (name of body part) with the ball of light, feel the warm energy healing your_____.” </p>

<P>“The light is full of healing energy that is healing your (name of body part).”</p>


<P>“Your ______is becoming normal and healthy”

<P>Keep talking the subject through this healing process. This may have to be done several times, especially if the problem is chronic.</p> 

 
<P>Hypnosis is useful in many areas. It can be used to strengthen concentration, improve intelligence and memory, rid one's self of phobias, and bad habits, establishing good habits and so on.
