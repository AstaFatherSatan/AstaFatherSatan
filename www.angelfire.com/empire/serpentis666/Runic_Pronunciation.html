<P>In Kabalistic "Speech," each of the letters must be correctly vibrated. 
Kabalistic sounds for each of the letters are a bit different than when used in 
everyday normal speech. 
<P>For vibrating the Runes, use the examples above. Basic Kabalistic 
pronunciation of the letters not listed in the above are as follows (note, it is 
important to pronounce the Runes as with the dialects in the above)The following 
is basic kabalistic speech: 
<P>A (see examples above) <BR>B is vibrated with the lips pursed. <BR>C is 
vibrated in the back of the throat, like a hard cat's hiss. <BR>For the letter 
D, follow the rules for the Gothic example above: <BR>Ð ð - English "TH" At 
start or end of word, th as in "<U>th</U>ing," in middle of word th as in 
"<U>th</U>ere." <BR>E is vibrated in the back of the throat as in making the 
sound for the letter Y, for example "Y-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E" while constantly 
vibrating the Y sound inthe throat. <BR>F is vibrated as a light V. <BR>G is 
vibrated in the back of the throat and is guttural, like softly gargling, but 
should be smooth and steady. <BR>For the letter H, use the rules for German: 
<BR>H h: as in German "na<U>ch</U>t" This is like the "ich" but a bit more 
pronounced with the back of the throat. <BR>To correctly vibrate the letter I, 
vibrate "ah" and switch to the long I to get the feel, this is also from the 
back of the throat. <BR>J is vibrated either softly as in the French "Jacques" 
or for some words, the hard English J, but make sure you can feel the vibration. 
<BR>K is vibrated, as in hacking up a spit. <BR>L, M, N, are vibrated as in 
normal English. <BR>O is vibrated as the long English "O" <BR>P is a bit tricky. 
Vibrate as for the letter B, (B is vibrated with the lips pursed), while at the 
same time, making the vibration for the letter V <BR>Q is the same as the letter 
C <BR>R is normally rolled, but can also be the English R, as in Gothic and Old 
English <BR>S at start or end of word, pronounce as S, as in "<U>S</U>atan." 
<UL>
  <LI>In middle of a word, pronounce as Z, as in <U>Z</U>ebra 
  <LI>Beside an unvoiced consonant, pronounce as S, as in "<U>S</U>atan." 
  <LI>Doubled (ss)pronounce as S, as in "<U>S</U>atan." </LI></UL>
<P>T is tricky. Vibrate "TH" while at the same time Z. It is between the two. 
<BR>TH is Th, as in "<U>Th</U>e." <BR>U is vibrated as in the word <U>oo</U>ze. 
<BR>V as in "<U>V</U>ery." <BR>W is the English W <BR>X, same as K <BR>Y, same 
as the English Y <BR>Z, same as the English Z 
<P>Now, for example, take the rune "ÜRUZ." To properly vibrate this rune would 
be as follows: 
<BR>Ü-Ü-Ü-Ü-Ü-Ü-Ü-Ü-Ü-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z 
 
<P>The R's should be rolled and the second U pronounced as in the word 
<U>oo</U>ze. Like a mantra, vibrating the runes is to be done repeatedly and 
should be for the number of times as is the number of the rune, or can be 
multiples of this number. Once you begin working with a certain rune, stay with 
the same number of times for each session. For example, say you are working with 
the ÜRUZ rune, which is the number two and you vibrate the rune 20 times (a 
multiple of 2), you should always vibrate this rune 20 times for the specific 
working.
