Note: for those who are new, xian/xianity = Christian/Christianity
<P>
 
I got into astrology early- in my pre-teens and was reading charts when I was in my mid-teens, along with the Tarot and reading palms. My point in writing this is I was relentlessly attacked by Christians for my knowledge of and belief in the Tarot and astrology. They really prey upon teens. I couldn't cross the street downtown without being accosted by Christian filth stopping me and harassing me. Back in those days, there was little serious opposition to that scum, and I certainly didn't know what I know now. This was all a learning experience for me though. 
<P>
Christians, like most other vile individuals who attack others are always more secure when they are with other xians and not alone. My eldest son and his friends really gave this xian street corner maggot a hard time when they were accosted [like nearly everyone else...minding their own business]. They formed a circle and began mocking him. In situations like this, that xian 'faith' goes out the window, and the xian gets insecure real fast, especially when alone. 
<P>
I have heard and experienced so much endless crap before coming to Satan, where I really began to confidently fight them. I have learned different ways to deal with them if you are pushed into it. I, myself have a real short fuse with the deluded scum. One idiot who obviously can't read [I have anti-xian signs on my front door], tried to harass me anyway and the stupid deluded idiot almost had a heart attack, I got so mad. 
<P>
In dealing with xians, there are certain things you can reply with, if you have the time, patience and wish to argue with them. 
<P>
1. I have heard this tactic ad nauseum over the years and it is a psychological game that vile individuals play when trying to coerce another person into believing as they do. Unfortunately, although this is used by xians relentlessly, others use it as well.
<BR>It goes like this:
<BR>You are not happy because you don't have the same belief system...you aren't 'saved' and that sort of thing. You get the general idea. Ok, every single thing in this person's life goes beautifully, They have total control over thier life and destiny and are blissfully happy at all times because of their belief system. Anyone who swallows this crock of shit needs a serious reality check to say the least. 
<P>
The truth is, unless someone is completely insane and in total denial of reality, everyone and everything on this earth has problems. Yes, there are degrees of problems and suffering, but no one is unscathed by this. Expert interrogators know this, as well as psychiatrists and others who work with human psychology. Everyone has their weak point. Everyone has a point where they will crack given it is found and played upon. Everyone has a saturn. Everyone experiences saturn tranists and hard times. There are people who are very adept at hiding their problems and pretending to be happy to the world. Remember this. This is not to say that one cannot be happy. My point here is xians use this shit to try to coerce others into believing as they do, while pretending everything is fine in their lives. All this takes to see the real truth is a little investigating and awareness, especially of their astro chart and you will find they have problems too. 
 
<P>2. Ask any xian who is accosting you and pushing their filth... How many people did Satan MURDER in that damned bible? Where are the scriptures???? Now, given my experiences with these deluded idiots, they keep on that 'the Devil was a murderer and a liar form the beginning.' Ok, so who was a murderer and a liar? Jehova, that's who! Look to the old testamant for PROOF. http://www.exposingchristianity.com/
<P>
Quote the scriptures to these deluded idiots. Here is just a few of many:
<P>Numbers 31:7 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males. 
<BR>31:8
And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. 
 
<P>THIS TRULY EVIL ENTITY EVEN TORTURED TO DEATH AND MURDERED HIS OWN SON
<BR>[Of course, we know the nazarene is fictitious, but when speaking to xians...]
<P>MORE:
<BR>Deuteronomy 7:1 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou; 
<BR>7:2
<BR>And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them
<P>
Then, the crap they spew about 'blood sacrifice'
<BR>Exodus 23:18 
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning. 
 
<P>PRETTY OBVIOUS.
 
<P>3. They insessantly state that 'the Devil hates humanity.' Ok, their bible also is proof on this one. Both that filthy nazarene and crud jewhova hate humanity blatantly. Anything of humanity is a 'sin.' Look to their filthy bible for proof on this. They can try to rationalize and warp the truth, but it reads what it reads. Damned near everything of human nature and natural law is a 'sin.' 
<BR><A HREF="../../../satanslibrary.org/ExposingChristianity/Copy_of_a_Catholic_Confession_Primer.html">Copy of a Catholic Confession Primer</a>
<P>
Also, their 'Devil' is supposed to be artifical. Is there ANYTHING in xianity that supports natural law? Also, their 'Devil' is supposed to be all material and non-spiritual. Is there ANYTHING of xianity that IS spiritual? NOTHING! 
<P>
4. They have repeated ad nauseum...'the Devil deceives...' 'He deceiveth all of the nations...' Well, all of the nations are either xian or muslim and of course the kike root of this malignant filth. 
Look to the REAL LIAR:
<P>
2 Thessalonians 2:11
<BR>And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: 
12 That they all might be damned 
<P>
Genesis 2: verses 16-17 reads: "And the Lord God, commanded the man, saying "of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: (17) But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
<P>
According to the Bible, the man, Adam, did not die in the day that he ate from the forbidden tree. For the Bible says that Adam and Eve were expelled from the garden and; Genesis 5: verse 5 reads: "And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died."
<BR>[The above two paragraphs were taken from: http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/emmett_fields/word_of_god_debate.html]
  <P>
Ezekiel 14:9 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
<P>
5. They harp on about how 'the Devil enslaves' and all of their deluded endless crap. Satan never enslaved anyone. Look to their old testament on this one as well. 
 
<P>The nazarene not only ADVOCATED SLAVERY, but encouraged and condoned the abuse of slaves:
<BR>Luke 12:47 
<BR>And that slave, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. 
<P>Ephesians 6:5
Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.
<P>
Xianity with its jewish root has been the cause of nearly every war fought throughout history. 'Onward christian soldiers.' 
<P>
There are some xian fools who might wake up. There are others who are a complete waste of time. And wasn't the nazarene a human sacrifice? 
<P>
<UL><LI>SATAN NEVER MURDERED ANYONE
<LI>SATAN NEVER LIED TO ANYONE
<LI>SATAN ACCEPTS YOU AS YOU ARE, AND DOES NOT HATE HUMAN NATURE
<LI>SATAN RULES OVER WHAT IS CALLED 'THE OCCULT' WHICH IS COMPLETELY SPIRITUAL
<LI>SATAN GIVES US KNOWLEDGE AND DOES NOT FEAR HUMAN SPIRITUAL ADVANCEMENT
<LI>SATAN DOES NOT FEAR HUMANITY
</UL>
<P>HAIL SATAN!!
