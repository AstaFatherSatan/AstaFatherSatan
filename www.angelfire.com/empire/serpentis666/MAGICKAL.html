Back in 1534, Benvenuto Cellini, an Italian Renaissance painter wanted to
experience a "magickal operation." He met with a Sicilian priest versed in the art
of ritual magick, a friend Vincentio Romoli, a 12-year-old boy, and a second
magician, accompanying the priest. Cellini wanted the love of a woman. Of all the
places to choose for a ritual, they went to the Roman Coliseum.<P>
They cast a nine-foot circle and after an hour and a half, some spirits showed up
and communicated to the group. They related that Cellini would have his love
within one month. Then something went terribly wrong. More and more spiritual
entities kept coming and then began getting aggressive. Within a short time,
"there were too many spirits present." The 12-year-old boy screamed, "They
were all being menaced by a million of the fiercest men they had ever seen."
"Four giants, fully armed, were trying to force their way into the circle." The child
cried out that "the Coliseum was on fire and that flames were rolling towards
them."<P>
The group huddled together in terror, the magician threw more asafetida on the
fire in piles, and after a while, the spirits left in a fury. The group stayed huddled
until morning and only a few spirits remained "and these at a distance." Upon
leaving and running home, a couple of spirits chased them.<P>
The Roman Coliseum of all places was a very poor choice for a love ritual. One
person dying a violent death gives off negative energy, but thousands of violent
deaths along with the all of the death emotions- the Gladiators, lions and other
wild animals ripping people to shreds, and the intense violence leaves its mark
for centuries.<P>
A proper environment with energy that is in tune with the goals of the ritual is
important, obviously unwanted influences can affect a ritual or magickal
operation for the worst.<P>
Music, thoughts, recalling past experiences or fantasies are important as well to
creating a mood and environment supportive to the goals of the ritual.
