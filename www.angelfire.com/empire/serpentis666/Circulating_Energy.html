This meditation is the most powerful. It is done by martial artists and advanced meditators. It enables the practitioner to feel, control and direct energy. 

<P>Be patient. You more than likely will need 15 minutes
to half an hour set aside for this to begin with. Again, everything is individual. 
 In the beginning,
for most people, the energy will be slow in coming and
will move like molasses, but this varies according to one's development in past lives. Normally with repeated meditations, it
will speed up and you will be able to direct it at
will. 
<p>

This exercise is more in FEELING, rather than in
visualization.
<p>

1. Focus on your crown chakra. Just sit 3-4 minutes and meditate on this chakra. You may feel it as a sort of crawling sensation. This is normal. When one advances or on occasion, there is an intense feeling of bliss. You may also feel a pressure there. 


<P>2. Now focus on your third eye. Meditate on your third eye for several minutes. Feeling a pressure here is normal. 


<P>3. Move your attention to your throat chakra and do the same as with the above two chakras.



<P>4. Move your energy to your heart chakra and focus for a few minutes. 

<P>5. Focus now on your solar plexus and do the same. 

<P>6. Follow with your second/sacral chakra- do the same.

<P>7. Now focus on the area between your perinium. This is between the rectum and scrotum for men and between the rectum and vagina for women. This is a power spot. Visualize the energy glowing brightly like the sun here. 

<P>8. Move the energy to your base chakra and meditate for 3-4 minutes or so on your base chakra.

<P>9. Now, direct the energy up your spine into your second chakra. (This is the second chakra located on your spine- with the first circulation, we focused on the chakras in the front, we are now directing the energy up the back). 

<P>10. Continue to do the same, directing the energy up into each chakra, one by one located in the spine, until you reach your crown.

<P>11. This time, you can direct the energy without pausing, moving it along down the front of your body chakra by chakra until you stop again at the perinium and direct the energy up your spine. 

<P>Keep circulating the energy as long as you wish. This exercise will enable you to control and direct energy. This is the foundation of all power. You will establish a mind connection to where you are able to focus and the energy will follow. This can be used for healing, empowering or otherwise.
