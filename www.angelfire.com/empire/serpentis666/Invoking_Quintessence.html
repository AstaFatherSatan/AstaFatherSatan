<p>I have found the quintessence [akasha/ether] to act as a medium in amplifying energies and the powers of the soul. Ether is also said to impart "invisibility" in the way of one not being noticed. If you try this, it is very important to also do this with the void in not thinking, as thoughts give off energy. Of course, this does not mean physical invisibility, but invisibility in not being noticed, like a well-trained Ninja can do. 
 
<p>1. Visualize and feel yourself in the center of an unlimited
space. This will feel like floating. There is no above or below or sideways. The quintessence is ultra-violet, very similar to what is known as a black light. For those of you who are familiar with the black lights of the 1970's and how they illuminated florescent colors on posters, this is the color you should be visualizing as it is very powerful. Black lights are ultra-violet. If you are not familiar just type 'black light' into a search engine; also see 'images' of black lights; and black light bulbs. This energy is the first step in the non-visible spectrum of light. The soul is composed of both the visible and non-visible spectrums of light.
 
 
<p>2. Breathe in the akasha/ether, visualizing yourself completely surrounded by the ultra-violet
energy as you would with <a href="Foundation_Meditation.html">energy breathing</a> and fill your entire being with it for
eleven breaths.
 
<br>FEEL this energy and focus your mind and astral senses upon it. 
<p>3. Meditate on the feeling you get from invoking this energy for 10-15 minutes.
 
<p><i>"It has been mentioned in the theoretical part that the elements
originate in the akasha principle, by which they are dominated and
kept in the correct balance.
 
<br>After a long time of exercising, a magician who has achieved good
results with the elements will also be able to control the finest
principle that is the astral ether."
<p>"We have heard that akasha is the primary source, the sphere of all
causes. Any deliberate cause, such as a wish, a thought, any
imagination created in this sphere together with the dynamic
conviction is bound to be realized with the help of the elements,
regardless of the level or sphere on which the realization
necessarily has to be performed. This is one of the greatest magic
mysteries and a universal key for the magician, who will understand
its range only later on in the course of his development."</i>
<br>-Franz Bardon "Initiation into Hermetics" &#169; 1956
 
 
<p><br>Aether (classical element)
<br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
<br><i>(Redirected from Quintessence (alchemy))
<p>"The aether is the fifth classical element in ancient Greek philosophy and
science. This Greek concept seems to derive directly from the akasha, its Hindu
counterpart. In Greek doctrines it seems that the aether was the celestial fire, the
pure essence where the gods lived and which they breathed. In this connection,
it seems that aether is radiative heat like that of the sun, which is able to
propagate in empty space. The Greek word "aither" derives from an Indo-
European root aith- ("burn, shine"). This root figures in the name of Aithiopia
(Ethiopia), which means something like "burnt land."
<p>"Aether was once believed to be a substance, which filled all of space. Aristotle
included it as a fifth element (the quintessence) on the principle that nature
abhorred a vacuum."
<p>Oliver Nicholson points out that, in contrast to the better known luminiferous
aether of the 19th century, the older concept of the classical aether had three
properties. Among these characteristics, the classical aether had a non-material
property, was "less than the vehicle of visible light", and was responsible for
"generating metals" along with fostering the development of all bodies."
 
<p>[1]"Robert
Fludd stated that the aether was of the character that it was "subtler than light".
Fludd cites the 3rd century view of Plotinus, concerning the aether as penetrative
and non-material."
<p>"[2]"Other 1800s views, such as James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Nikola
Tesla, was of the disposition that the aether was more akin to it actually being the
electromagnetic field."
<p>"In modern physics, dark energy is sometimes called quintessence due to its
similarity to the classical ether."</i>
