<I>Had I as many souls as there be stars, I'd give them all for Mephistopheles!"<br>
        -Dr. Faustus</I>

<p><BR>*Please read the Frequently Asked Questions at the bottom of the page.

<P><BR><span>What happens when I make a formal commitment to Satan?</span>
<br>Satan looks out for his own. Satan gives us an inner strength and we become
very strong in spirit. Unlike right hand path religions, where adherents are
forever praying and searching for their god, Satan comes to us on his own.
Many times, we can feel him. He comes to guide us when we get down, worried,
or are experiencing problems.
</p>

<p>He snaps us into line and directs us as to what we need to do to be focused
and happy.

<P> The foundation of Spiritual Satanism is in our finishing Satan's work upon
humanity. This is the goal of the godhead, and is accomplished through power
meditation. Humanity is currently at a very low level spiritually. When we
begin to meditate, we experience profound positive changes within our lives.
Satan and his Demons (The Original Gods) protect us and look out for us as
we transform and achieve personal power. With Satan, we have protection that
outsiders do not have. We can advance in the powers of the mind and soul as
far as we wish. For outsiders, this can prove dangerous.


<P>Satan also gives us knowledge. <I>"I lead to the straight path without a book." </I> 

<BR>As we transform and grow, our lives change for the better and we are much
happier. We learn through Satan how to take control of our own lives and
destiny instead of being at the mercy of fate. We learn to heal ourselves,
and to fulfill our own desires, using the powers of our mind and soul.



<p> In making a commitment, we engage a formal ritual. This is done out of free
will. We are making a choice, as opposed to being dragged off to some
Christian church, and reciting canned prayers (stolen and corrupted from
Eastern mantras) in front of a bunch of idiots.



<P> With knowledge and research, we can prove beyond all doubt that the
nazarene, "jehova" and ilk are all fictitious characters, stolen from and
corrupted concepts to remove all spiritual knowledge so that a "chosen" few
can rule the world using powers of the mind and soul.  For further information, please visit <a href="../../../satanslibrary.org/ExposingChristianity/EXPOSING_CHRISTIANITY_MAIN.html">www.exposingchristianity.com</a>

<BR>Because so many have been forcefully indoctrinated with these characters,
and what they stand for (Enemies of Satan), we renounce them permanently in
the dedication ritual. This proves to be psychologically healthy and
liberating.


<p> The initiation ritual is very personal, unless you decide to have friends
participate, or are doing it as part of a group.

<p>You will need:
<UL>
<LI> 1 or more black, blue or red candles (as many as you like)
<LI>A sterilized needle or razor
<LI> A piece of clean paper, large enough to write the prayer below

<LI> A dry pen, where you sign your name in blood (dip the tip of the pen in your
blood) NOTE* YOU ONLY SIGN YOUR <U>NAME</U> IN BLOOD, NOT ANYTHING ELSE ON THE PAPER. 
</ul>


<p>Write the following prayer:
<P><blockquote><P><I> Before the almighty and ineffable God Satan/Lucifer and in the presence of
all Demons of Hell, who are the True and the Original gods, I, (state your
full name) renounce any and all past allegiances. I renounce the false
Judeo/Christian god Jehova, I renounce his vile and worthless son Jesus
Christ, I renounce his foul, odious, and rotten holy spirit.

<p>I proclaim Satan Lucifer as my one and only God. I promise to recognize and
honor him in all things, without reservation, desiring in return, his
manifold assistance in the successful completion of my endeavors.
</I></blockquote>

<p> It is important to bathe before any rituals you perform, this is done out of
respect. When you are ready, you can light the candle. Take the needle,
prick the index finger of your left hand, squeeze some blood out.

<P>Sign your name in blood.</p>

       <p>Recite the prayer either aloud or in your head

<p> Fold the paper and let it burn in the fire of the candle. Many of us have
stayed and meditated until the candle had burned itself out.

<p>At the end of the ritual, close with the words "So mote it be."  And a Big "HAIL SATAN!!"</p>

<P>&nbsp;<BR>Frequently Asked Questions/concerns:
<P><font color="FFFFFF">Question:
<BR><font color="ff0000">Can I perform the ritual more than once?</FONT>
<BR>Answer:
<BR>NO! Satanic rituals are real and binding. The ritual should only be done ONE TIME!

<P><font color="FFFFFF">Question:
<BR><font color="ff0000">I performed the ritual. I could barely get any blood on the paper, is the ritual still valid? </FONT>
<BR>Answer:
<br>YES!! The amount of blood does not matter, this is only a formality. What is in our hearts and what our intentions are, are much more important than the amount of blood in our signature.

<P><font color="FFFFFF">Question:
<BR><font color="ff0000">Can I reverse the ritual at a later date?</FONT>
<br>Answer:
<br>Satanic rituals, unlike the rituals in other religions, are real and permanent. I received a very small number of letters from people who were confused and harassed by Christians. One person performed a reverse ritual and Satan left him. Totally. Satan does not push himself on anyone. 
<BR>Christians are deceived. They believe their "God" to be "loving" and "forgiving." In truth, this monster is a spiteful, hateful attacker of human beings. When one is with Satan, one is always under his protection. He looks out for us and we enter a new life where we no longer have the worries that others endure. Things are not perfect, but they are always much better. Satan does not punish people who reject him, he simply leaves and one is left all alone to endure the torments of the enemy. 
<P>These people wrote to me because after several months, they were begging for Satan to take them back. The enemy did absolutely nothing for them. All were extremely regretful they ever left and very desperate to come back. 

<P><font color="FFFFFF">Question:
<br><font color="ff0000">I am under-age and my parents would cause me serious problems if they ever caught me doing a Satanic ritual.</FONT>
<br>Answer:
<br>If there is absolutely no way you can perform the ritual without placing yourself in danger, you can perform it in your <a href="Temple.html">astral temple.[Click Here]</a><br>You can do the above ritual  when you are older. Performing the dedication on the astral is every bit as valid as doing it physically. Satan is very understanding concerning teens who are forced into accepting Christianity while living at home and being underage. 

<P><font color="FFFFFF">Question:
<br><font color="ff0000">I am underage, living in a Christian home and my parents force me to go to church and participate in Christian sacraments. Can I still do the dedication? Will Satan be angry with me?</FONT>

<br>Answer:
<br>Yes, you can still perform the ritual. Satan understands. As long as you are loyal to him in your heart, he will not be angry with you. Those of you under 18 are not free. There is no need to reveal your allegiance to Satan to anyone. What is in your heart is more important than anything else. Satan advises us in the Al-Jilwah not to reveal our religion to outsiders if it will cause us harm in any way, this is especially important for teens. Just renounce the Christian "God" in your mind if you are forced to participate in any of his garbage. Satan understands it can be downright dangerous, and in some cases even life-threatening for teens living in Christian homes to reveal their allegiance to him.
