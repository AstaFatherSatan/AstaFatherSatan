One of the most important things we can do as
Satanists, is to establish a strong relationship with
Satan. Many people look to books, writings, and other
information, instead of going directly to Satan himself. Reading books can open a door, but this also instills in one’s mind many assumptions, that
when meeting him and getting to know him, we
find are false and confusion ensues. 

<P>
There has been so much
Misinformation, slander and lies written about Father Satan.
Nearly all, if not entirely, this has been invented
and spread by his enemies, people who don't know him,
people out to make a fast buck and people
indoctrinated with Christian or other related lies. 
<P>

These lies have shaped much of the mass mind concerning
Satan. I receive many e-mails from people who have
been misinformed and expect Satan to be a certain
way. Take the Satanic Bible and the advocating of
greed. I can tell you from experience, Satan is not
greedy. We can easily see how greedy the Christian Churches are. 
Nearly everything of what the false enemy god is and does, is
blamed on Satan as a distraction. 
<P>

True Satanism is not a trip through Disneyland. True
Satanism is about personal advancement along with becoming and evolving into a god, which brings spiritual liberation. Satan helps us in our lives
with whatever we need, but in contrast to the many
stories, he does not
bestow extreme riches, fame and fulfill every wish in
exchange for one's soul. 
<P>

When we give our souls to Satan, he assists us with bestowing upon us much knowledge, direction, wisdom and personal power that will enable us to
evolve and advance into godhead. When we die, we will no
longer be just a spirit, we will emerge much more
powerful and if we reincarnate, we will be born into a
higher existence, a better life. In advancing to become a god, one's life will change for the better. One will no longer have to tolerate injustice as one will have serious power and understanding, way beyond that of the average person, with the ability to heal one's self and affect one's environment, influence and even control others.
<P>

One advances by living life to the fullest, pushing
one's self past physical, psychological, mental and
spiritual limitations and overcoming boundaries. Inactivity and
abstinence lead to degeneration. The human body is a
perfect example in that muscles that are not used, atrophy. A
mind that is unused becomes dull and stupid. The same
can be said for the human soul.
