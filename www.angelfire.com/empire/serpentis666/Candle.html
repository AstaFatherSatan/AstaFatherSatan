Black is an all-purpose color and when available, black should be used with other
colors in every ritual. Different colors attract different energies and stimulate
certain vibrations in the chakras. Using candles of specific colors can help to
amplify the energies in ritual and spell work. 

<P><span>Black Candles</span> are all-purpose for any Satanic rituals. Black candles used in
workings of destruction are used to incite the slower destruction of enemies,
opposed to accidents or sudden attacks associated with the color red. Black is
also a good color to use to bring discord and confusion to enemies. Black can be
used for protection, binding negative forces, and breaking up obstacles and
blocks. Black can also be used to reverse and break up negative thoughtforms.
Black absorbs, conceals, creates confusion and chaos, is used for new
beginnings, and obtaining knowledge of hidden things. Black is the container of
light, and is one of the most powerful of colors. Saturn rules black. Black
influences self-control, endurance, and patience. Spells using black energy are
best performed during a waning Moon, on a Saturday when the planet Saturn is
strongly placed and waxing. Spells using black need the power of the root
chakra.
<P>

<span>Blue Candles</span> are good to use in spells pertaining to spirituality, meditation,
summoning Demons, healing, sincerity, obtaining the truth, influencing fidelity
and loyalty, bringing inner peace, and for knowledge and wisdom. Blue can also
be used for establishing harmony in the home, for increasing occult power, and
for spiritual protection.
For workings of black magick, blue can be used for inciting depression, sadness,
and hopelessness, lack of sympathy, coldness, and gloom.

 <br>Jupiter rules royal blue. Workings using blue energy should be done on a
Monday or Thursday. Spells using blue need the power of the crown and and/or
throat chakras.
<P>

<span>Brown Candles</span> can be used for communicating with nature spirits and for
grounding and centering one&#146;s self. Brown is used in spells for solidity, neutrality,
and practicality. In workings of black magick, brown is used for inciting
indecision, hesitancy, sadness, dullness, and uncertainty.
For working with brown energy, the feet chakras are used. Energy should be
absorbed from the earth through the feet chakras.

<P><span>Green Candles</span> are used in spells for beginnings, growth, abundance, fertility,
healing, success, general good luck, harmony, and influencing generosity. In
workings for health and healing, green is an anti-inflammatory. Green can also
be used alone or with brown for communicating with nature spirits. Green is used
in spells for love, marriage, and making love. Green influences affection,
opposed to red, which is used for passionate love, lust, and sex. Green also
influences renewal, fidelity, reconciliation, justice, balance, beauty, youth,friendships, attraction, harmony, financial gain, earnings increases, social
functions, possessions, riches, indulgence, and pleasure. Green is good for
beginnings and growth.
<BR>
In workings of black magick, green is used for inciting jealousy, greed, suspicion,
resentment, sickness, disease, and disharmony.
Venus rules the color green. Workings using green energy should be performed
during a waxing moon on a Friday when Venus is strongly placed. Spells using
green need the power of the heart chakra.


<P>

<span>Grey Candles</span> are used in spells for inducing death, illness, and/or to incite
mourning and sadness. Saturn should be strongly placed.
<P>

<span>Orange Candles</span> are used for creativity. Orange helps in spells for adaptability,
sexual attraction, sexual stimulation, sex magick, enthusiasm, and energy.
Orange helps with attraction, sudden changes, energy stimulation, gaining
control, changing luck and inciting justice. The Sun rules orange. Workings using
orange energy are best performed on a Sunday when the Sun is strongly placed.
Spells using orange need the power of the sacral and/or solar chakras. For
inciting lust and sexual attraction, use the sacral and root chakras.

<P>
<span>Red Candles</span> are used for energy, vitality, inciting passion, arousing anger, pure
lust and for physical gratification. Red is inflammatory and is used in spells for
revenge, anger, courage, determination, and dealing with enemies. Red can be
used for protection against psychic attack and for self-confidence. Red incites
accidents, fires, and injuries. It is used in spells to invoke power and intensity
before workings of black magick. Red is physical and bestows energy, strength,
dynamism, passionate love, physical desire, will power, and athletic ability
(especially competitive).<BR>When used in black magick, red as opposed to black brings on sudden attacks,
accidents, bloodshed, violence, and hatred. Red can also be used to incite wars,
anarchy, and cruelty. Mars rules red. Workings using the color red need the
power of the root chakra and should be performed on Tuesdays when Mars is
strongly placed and waxing. 
<P>

<span>Violet/Purple Candles</span> are used for enhancing psychic ability, bringing wisdom,
for divination, to remove curses, for healing, business success, and for
influencing people in power.

<P>For workings of black magick, purple can be used to incite tyranny, abuse of
power, and for bringing sadness and treachery to others. Jupiter rules purple.
Workings using the color purple should be performed on Thursdays. Workings for
psychic power need the energy of the sixth chakra and the third eye and should
be performed on Mondays when the Moon is strongly placed and full.
<P>

<span>Yellow Candles</span> are used in workings for passing exams, and for increasing
one’s intelligence and intellect. Yellow energy rules over the logical conscious
side of the brain, computers, communication, audio, video, TV, electronics, books, literature and the will. Yellow is used to improve the mind, to deepen
concentration, for mental (left-brained power), to enhance learning ability, and for
speech, writing, and publishing. Yellow rules over media concerns, gossip,
slander, interviews, brothers, sisters, neighbors, rumors, theft, and all areas of
study and communication. Spiritually, yellow can be used for astral travel (along
with blue and purple). Yellow is also used to overcome addictions, and to break
habits. Yellow is good for friendship.<BR>In workings of black magick, yellow is used to incite infidelity, cowardice, decay,
disease, dying, insanity, and inconsistency in others.
<P>Mercury rules over the color yellow. Workings using yellow energy need the
power of the solar and throat chakras. Both of these chakras work as a pair.
Yellow energy is best used on Wednesdays and Sundays. For anything
pertaining to intellect and communication, do the working on a Wednesday. For
workings using the force of will, these are best performed on a Sunday.

<P><span>White Candles</span> are for cleansing, purity, and innocence. The Moon should be
strong.

<P>For workings of black magick, white can be used to incite corruption, bring
impotence, and to destroy the sex drive. White can also be used to create
weakness, neurosis, and fear. The Moon rules white. Workings using white
energy should be performed on a Monday and need the energy of the third eye.<P>

More than one color can be used in rituals. The candles should be anointed with
appropriate scents and oils before ritual. Oil should be applied with both hands in
a stroking motion. Candles represent the element of fire in rituals and are also
used for concentration and focus. They attract Demons and spirits.<P>

Always make sure to check your candle as a test as you would with incense
before beginning a ritual. Bad odors or burning the wrong way as with cheap
incense can ruin a ritual.
