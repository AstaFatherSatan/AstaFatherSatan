<p><br><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">These meditations are extremely 
 
advanced and can be dangerous to newbies. One should be experienced in 
 
meditation, energy manipulation, invoking the elements and in understanding of what 
 
he/she is doing on the astral level. 
 
<p><br><p>To begin with any of these meditations, one must be thoroughly 
 
relaxed. Being disturbed by others, loud noises, the phone ringing, visitors or anything 
 
else, including being touched by animals can be dangerous. 
 
<p>MEDITATING UPON THE AURA:
 
<p>1. To sense and feel your aura: expand your awareness out past your physical 
 
self a few inches and sense your aura's energy. 
<p>2. FEEL your aura and meditate upon it for a few minutes. 
<p>3. Expand and contract your aura. 
<p>4. Breathe energy into and out of your aura. 
<p>5. If you feel you are ready, you can invoke each of the elements into your aura. 
 
These should be done slowly, no more than seven breaths to begin with. It is best to 
 
only go with one element per day.
<p>6. Meditate on the feeling of each element after invoking into your aura.  
<p>7. If you feel uncomfortable, just breathe the element back out.
 
<p><br><p>MEDITATING UPON THE LIGHT BODY:
 
<p>1. The light body can be felt by expanding your awareness to the energy within 
 
your body. This can be felt.

<p>2. FEEL your light body and meditate upon this. 
<p>3. Breathe in energy into and out of your light body.
 
<p><br><p>MEDITATING UPON YOUR MENTAL BODY:
<p>1. Focus inward upon your awareness. This is your mental body. 
<p>2. Wherever you focus your attention, this is your mental body. 
<br>When we expand our awareness, we expand this aspect of our soul. 
<p>3. Meditate on being aware of your mental body.
