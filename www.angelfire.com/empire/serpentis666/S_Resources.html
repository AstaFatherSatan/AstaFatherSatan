Below is a list of books and DVDs. Always remember to read and view everything the Satanic way, with discretion, as so much has been corrupted. Satan leads us to the truth. The more you open your mind and soul, you will be able to see the truth for yourself much easier. 

<P>I can only take everyone so far, to advance beyond what is on the JoS website, you will need to purchase a few books listed below, or search further online for the resources listed here. The goal of True Satanism is personal power. The exercises in the books and DVDs listed below drastically increase that power. Never mind the new age bullshit and hype that unfortunately comes along with some of it. Use it the Satanic way- WE USE WHATEVER WORKS! The effects of the exercises in the books and DVDs are exceptionally powerful in amplifying the witchpower and opening the mind, intuition and much more. 

<P>Both the books and DVDs can be obtained through <A HREF="https://amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> for a lesser price. Links below are to Amazon for identifying the products. 

<P>Books:

by  M.S.S. Gurucharan Singh Khalsa</a> 
<BR>This book is for those who are already proficient in hatha yoga. The exercises therin are intense manipulations of the spine to facilitate the ascension of the serpent. One should create their own program with selected exercises with consideration to individual needs, personal time, etc. 
<br>ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BEGIN SLOWLY WITH MUCH FEWER REPETITIONS! PATIENCE HERE IS THE KEY. MOST PEOPLE SHOULD GRADUALLY BUILD SLOWLY!
