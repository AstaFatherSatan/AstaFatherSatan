This aura of protection works best when begun and performed during a waxing Moon <a href="VOID.html">[make sure the moon is not void of course when you begin this working]</a> and 
should be applied when your aura is completely eradicated of any negative 
energy. <a href="Aura_Cleaning.html">[See "Cleaning your Aura"]</a>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">In addition, if you have any familiars [animals who are close to you], it is also important to clean their 
auras and souls as well. [See below]. 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">Open with the following prayer: 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3"><i>Hear me oh Great and Mighty Satan. I ask your help in returning these 
curses, amplified to the senders who have attacked us for doing your work. You 
know who they are. They will know your wrath. I ask that you send a Demon to me 
to take and deliver the curses and thoughtforms that I have cleaned from my aura 
and soul directly to those who have sent them. O Mighty Satan, fill me with 
truth, wisdom and understanding, keep me strong in my faith and service, that I 
may abide always in Thee with Praise, Honor, and Glory be given Thee forever and 
ever.</i> 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">1. Visualize a brilliantly bright Sun directly above your head. 

</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">Affirm: 
<br>&ldquo;The light is cleaning and removing any and all negative energy, thoughtforms, bindings, ill will, and 
curses on or connected to my soul that have been directed to me, and is 
returning them to the senders.&rdquo; State this 3 times. 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">2. Visualize this Sun descending down into your head and pushing down any 
dirt, filth, thoughtforms [thoughtforms can appear as chunks of filth or for 
those who are advanced, you can see them as they may be shapes, symbols, like 
elementals, or otherwise]. This will be gray or black energy [as it collects], 
and will get darker as it descends. 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">3. Visualize the brilliant light descending through your throat, down through 
your shoulders, chest, then stomach area, hips and all the way down through your 
feet, pushing out all of the dirt from your aura and soul. 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">4. Move the filth beside you, in a pile. 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">5. DO THIS THREE TIMES, steps 1 through 4. Keep piling the dirt. 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">6. When you are finished, your aura and soul should be much brighter and 
cleaner. You can either ask for a Demon to take the energy and to return it to 
the senders [especially if you're new], OR, you can visualize it shooting away 
from you, directing it to the senders. 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3"><br>For Familiars: 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3"><img src="Animal_Chakras.gif"> 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">The above illustration is both the same for a cat or a dog, a horse and all 
four legged animals. Snakes and other reptiles have their chakras lined up along 
their bodies the same way. Some members also have spiders. For cleaning a spider 
familiar, just visualize the spider engulfed in a brilliant Sun and pull the Sun 
from its body, pushing out any negative energies. The same goes for other small 
familiars. 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">You should do the exact same ritual above for your familiar/s. This is 
extremely important. You can also use an astral brush or comb [visualize this] 
in addition and brush any astral negativities from his/her fur, piling it up in 
the same way, and returning it to the senders. 
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">Your familiar protects your soul. It is important to clean his/her aura 
frequently. Also, to build a powerful aura of protection around him/her. This 
should be done every day during a waxing Moon. I will post this shortly.
