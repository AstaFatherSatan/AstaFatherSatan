Most of us are familiar with psychiatry, counseling, psychology, and other mental
health services. The methods used are standard. Most professionals prod the
patient into expressing repressed feelings- anger, hatred, envy, resentment and
other related emotions, including repressed sexuality and sexual feelings.
Acknowledging these repressed emotions sheds new light on the origins of
serious hang-ups, neuroses, compulsions/obsessions and other serious mental
health disorders. Many physical ailments are brought about by repressed
emotions. Some of these end in death. These have a very detrimental effect
upon one’s soul and spiritual being as well.<P>
The New Age movement, Wicca, many Eastern religions [Such as modern
Buddhism, which have been Judeo/Christianized], and others all advocate denial
of expressing so-called "baser" emotions. This leads to poor mental health and
worse. Catholic priests are a blatant example of the consequences of sexual
repression. Sexual repression is about the worst, as the sex drive is as powerful
as and is tied directly to the life force; it doesn’t just go away. Anything that is
repressed comes out in warped, distorted, and unhealthy ways. Many problems
would be avoided if people would vent their feelings and stop repressing them.
This isn’t about going on a rampage; it is just acknowledging one’s own feelings
and letting them out. One should always be honest with one’s self.<P>
By denying anger, hatred, jealousy, and other so-called "negative" emotions, one
is laying a pattern for serious problems down the road. People who claim to love,
love, and love, and deny their anger and hatred, take on that artificial alien
deadpan smile that is so common amongst Christians in the advanced stages of
Christianity. Inside, these people are extremely unbalanced and are literally like
grenades with the pins pulled, just waiting to explode, either turning their pent up
anger out on others or in upon themselves. This is extremely unhealthy. Yet, they
consistently excuse the hatred and wrathful behavior of the false “God” they
worship. This sets the stage for serious mental illness.<P>
Another common teaching is denial of materialism. The reason for this is so
wealth and power can be kept in the hands of a few- the same people at the top
who work to remove spiritual knowledge and replace it with Christianity, Islam, and other
lies. Material possessions make life more enjoyable and are an extension of
ourselves. There should be a healthy balance between spiritualism and
materialism. The merging of the material with the spiritual is the key to attaining
the godhead of the soul.<P>
No one has a right to dictate to others how they should feel about someone or
something. Ritual is often an excellent means of venting emotions. Anything that
is consciously and intentionally repressed will cause serious problems later on.
