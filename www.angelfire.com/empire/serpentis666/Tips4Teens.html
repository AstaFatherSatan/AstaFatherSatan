Tips to Conceal:
<P>


1. Don't keep all of your prized books, tools, and
candles in one place.
(In the event that these are found, they will not all
be thrown away at once
as happened to me years ago. Not to mention the
"Bar-BQ" my parents had
with the books another time.)
<P>

2. Try to "slowly" temper candles as decorations in
various areas so they
will not be considered of any nature other than
novelty. (But keep them as
your own so nobody else can light them.)
<P>

3. Develop a "thing for incense." Begin to light
incense on occasion -- as
you read or do your "thing" -- in your room. My
"friends" range from my age
or older "thirties crowd" to high school -- I just
helped "Shorty"'s
girlfriend with her homework. This is simply because
I am extremely odd --
but that is not the point. The point is -- all of the
youngsters seem to be
using incense. At first it had been only the
"stoners" but it caught on to
everyone eventually. If it becomes a routine (use
cheap sticks or something
for this) then it is one less conspicuous.
<P>

4. Begin "writing a short play/script" which will be
a new interest for
you, so you would say (writing plays as a hobby and/or
acting and
directing). This will not only cover your reasons for
having bizarre
"props" and "fx" (special effects) paraphernalia --
but also be a secret
"Book of Shadows" to which you may journal your
magical training but "cover"
as a script until you are more independent.
<P>

DEFINITELY come up with a story. Maybe the "play" (if
you opt for this one)
is not in your possession and you and your friend are
simply rehearsing. In
the worst case scenario -- you are trying to
re-construct the story which
your hard drive erased. If you have a cam-corder --
the scene is always
"all screwed up." You may actually begin to like the
idea, and film several
little "home movies" which would likely result in
support. Then it would be
hard for them to know certainly what is real, and what
is imaginary. Just
"stay in between" once (if) your "image" is
established. This is ONE of
many ideas.
