Energy from stars can be used to enhance personal traits, for example to strengthen self-discipline. Specific stellar energies can also be used used in rituals. Absorbing energy from Venus before performing a love spell can greatly assist in the desired outcome of the working. It is very important to know the nature of the star/s you intend to invoke energy from, as some stars such as Polaris and Caput Algol are extremely destructive and people who have invoked these energies have gone insane. 
<BR>In order to effectively absorb stellar energies, one should be experienced with breathing in energy. The <a href="Energy_Meditation.html">Energy meditation</a> trains us on how to do this.


<P>This exercise should be performed outdoors where you can see the star clearly. 
 <P>Steps:
 <OL>
<LI>Relax and go into a trance. 
 <LI> Close your eyes and say the name of the star several times while visualizing it.  [Photos of stars can be seen by typing the name of the star or constellation into a search engine and clicking on “images.”] 

<LI>Keep repeating the name of the star either silently or aloud several times and try to feel the star. You should begin to feel the energy. 

<LI>Now charge your aura with energy until your entire being is glowing. This is done through visualization. Breathe in the energy from the earth into your feet and fill your entire being with it.  Now, stand beneath the star and visualize a line of energy about a foot wide extending from your aura and connect it with the star. 
<BR>Begin to breathe in the energy from the star. The energy of each star has a <a href="Color.html">specific color</a> according to its attributes. Visualize the stellar energy saturating and expanding your aura with this color upon each inhale. You can program the energy with affirmations while you are breathing it in. For example, you can affirm: "I am breathing in green energy from Venus that is bringing me plenty of free and easy money in a happy way that is all mine to keep and spend as I please." Visualize your entire being saturated with green and with each inhale, the green becomes more and more vibrant and powerful.
</OL>
<P>A guideline for the colors of stars is:
 <UL>
 <LI>Red- Martian energy, anger, violence, pure lust. 
 <LI>Blue- peaceful, calming, spiritual,
 <LI>Yellow- intellect; mind
 <LI>White- cleansing, strength
 <LI>Orange- creativity 
</UL>

<P>Tips:
<UL>
<LI>You can use a crystal to absorb and store energy from stars to be used at a later time in a ritual or whenever you need it. Hold the crystal under the star in your palm and breathe in energy from the star through your hand chakras, only bring it into the crystal. Just visualize it entering the crystal and brightening and/or intensifying in the crystal. When you want to absorb the stored energy, just hold the crystal in your hand, and breathe in the energy through your hand. Visualize the energy entering your hand and extending to your entire being and aura. The crystal can also be placed over any chakras you choose for desired effects. Just breathe in the energy.

<br><br><LI>A variation of the above is to program the crystal to absorb the stellar energy and leave it out under the star for as long as the star is visible and shining on it. Just focus your will into the crystal and tell it you want it to absorb energy from whatever star you choose. Repeat the name of the star several times and project the image of the star into your crystal using your third eye.
 
<br><br><LI>You can also absorb energy from entire constellations. This should be done a little at a time until you are familiar with the energies and the effects. 

<br><br><LI>An advanced practice is to absorb the energies of a star you are familiar with into your chakras. Don’t do this unless you are already comfortable with the star’s effects and energies. Just breathe in the energy. You should be familiar and experienced with <a href="Chakra_Breathing.html">Chakra Breathing.</a> It is best to work with stellar energies that are in harmony with the chakra you are working on. The energies should be of the same color.

<br><br><LI>You can make star charged water. Use a clean magnet, place it at the bottom of a container of water and program it like a crystal. The water will absorb the energy. By drinking the water, you will absorb the energy. This can be an easier way to learn about the energies of the star you wish to work with, before seriously absorbing any of its energies.
</UL>

<P>Here is a list of stars and their energies. To learn more regarding the time of year the star is visible, and the appearance of the star or constellation, there is much available on the internet and at public libraries under the subject of astronomy.  

 
<p><BR>FIXED STARS:
Allow 1 - 2 degrees orb for conjunctions and oppositions to other planets. Conjunctions and oppositions are the only aspects that matter, with conjunctions being most important. The following interpretations concern when a fixed star is conjunct a planet in one's chart or an angle or is prominent. The nature of the planet also should be blended in with the nature of the fixed star. Personal planets such as chart ruler/s and angles are important, with the influence of the fixed star being emphasized in both the life affairs and in the personality. 
 
<p>The four most prominent fixed stars are: 
<UL>
<LI>Aldebaran; 9 degrees of Gemini
<LI>Regulus; 29 degrees of Leo
<LI>Antares; 9 degrees of Sagittarius
<LI>Formalhaut; 3 degrees of Pisces
</UL>
<p>These stars can also be prominent in magick.
<UL>
<LI> Aldebaran is known as "Watcher of the East."
<LI>Regulus is known as "Watcher of the North."
