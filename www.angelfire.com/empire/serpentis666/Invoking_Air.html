 The Characteristics of Air: 
<br>People with the element of air prominent have the ability to be objective and detached, and unemotional. They are intellectual; enjoy spontaneity, easily bored, very talkative and communicative. Air is the most social of the elements. Air people are usually quick in their movements and speedy. They can be very impractical. Air lacks feeling and emotion. Air is pure intellect. Air people can adapt and adjust to situations easily. They can have an over-active mind, live in their head, and be Jack-Of-All-Trades, and master of none. Air lacks depth. The sayings "up in the air" "air headed", "cool headed" are relevant to air. An imbalance of too much air creates a lack of planning, makes one scatterbrained, nervousness, high-strung, and causes nervous exhaustion.
 
<p>A LACK of air makes one have a hard time detaching as the tendency is to become too emotionally involved. People who lack air can find themselves too involved with others. They can be overly emotional, have violent reactions, lash out, and have a very difficult time with being objective. They can have a hard time adjusting to new situations. The emotions often dominate in one who is lacking the air element. They can become obsessed. Air is the communicative, intellectual principle. 

<p>NOTE: I have observed some of the above traits in regards to a lack of air, but I have also found that a lack of an element can manifest with one expressing the element in an entirely different way. Helen Keller, both blind and deaf from her early childhood [this is how the lack of air manifested in her chart, along with her chart ruler being at 15 degrees of Leo, a degree that can cause blindness and/or deafness]; she spent her entire life communicating. She authored several books and gave numerous speeches in spite of her handicaps. 
 
<p>&nbsp;<p>INVOKING AIR:
<br>Sit quietly and go into a light to medium trance. Now, imagine yourself in the air. Feel the lightness and breathe in the air element. It is important to imagine yourself feeling lighter and lighter and airy. Imagine that your body is becoming lighter, as light as air itself to where you can no longer feel your body. Feel as if you are floating. 
<br>Do this for seven breaths AND ONLY SEVEN BREATHS! DO NOT DO ANY MORE! YOU CAN EVEN DO AS LITTLE AS 2-3 BREATHS, BUT NO MORE THAN SEVEN! 
 
<p>You have two options for this exercise: 
 
<p>1. You can breathe the air back out into the ether after each inhalation and even breath it out some more when you are finished with the seven breaths (This is the safest way) OR 
 
<p>2. You can retain the air. With retention of the elements, you will progress faster, understand how each element feels and affects you and increase your ability to handle each element, but remember- this is not for everyone. It is better to take things slower and use caution. Remember to always use common sense. 
 
<p>After some 12-24 hours, sit quietly and meditate a few minutes on how you feel after invoking air. 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;<p>The air element is used in rituals to incite chaos. Air can over-stimulate the nervous system until you get used to it so it is important to go slowly. Invoking air is used for levitation.
