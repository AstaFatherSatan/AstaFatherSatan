The first time I successfully invoked him, I felt like I had the power to take on the whole world and then some. The energy and the physical strength he gave me was incredible, and even that was not even a fraction of Malphas’ power and strength. He has been with me for a long time, even before I dedicated. Malphas was also with me during the awakening of my kundalini.
