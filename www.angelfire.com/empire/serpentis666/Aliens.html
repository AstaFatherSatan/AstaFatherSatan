When I was new, I asked Satan during a ritual "Who are you?" as I had 
no clue. I believed him to be some sort of spirit, but the voices in 
my head and my interaction with him indicated he is a real being. 
Very soon afterwards, in less than 24 hours following the ritual, I came 
across <A HREF="../../../www.luciferianliberationfront.org/llf2.html">the Luciferian Liberation Front.</a> I knew this was an answer to my 
question. 
<P>
I have spent years studying a variety 
of occult subjects. In addition, I have had many experiences and have 
learned from the experiences of others, both Joy of Satan High Priests/esses and members. The 
evidence of alien extra-terrestrials is overwhelming.  In the 
Egyptian images and monoliths, the pyramids are spaced and directed 
towards the constellation of Orion* and the spaces between the 
pyramids correlate with the distance of the stars in the Belt of 
Orion.&#185; 
<BR>*Satan and the “Powers of Hell” are of “The Empire of Orion.” O.R.I.O.N. which also stands for the well-known slogan “Our Race Is Our Nation.” 

<P> 
The Judeo/Christian Bible is chock full of BLATANT UFO activity. Many deluded 
individuals believe the Christian "God" to be a perfect force, above the 
comprehension of any human being. The truth is, the Judeo/Christian Bible 
REPEATEDLY describes a jealous, wrathful, spiteful and hateful being known as 
“Yaweh/Jehovah” with emotions no different from that of psychologically unbalanced human beings, though even more depraved in comparison. The indifference to suffering 
indicates cruelty. The alien entity is 
aware of the human emotions of wrath, anger, hatred and jealousy resulting in wars, murder and genocide that most human beings strive to avoid. The concept of "love" here is not 
understood and is missing. To the Christian entity, it is merely a word used for control, nothing more. The entity, is obviously 
devoid of any sublime emotions, and does not understand the concept of "love." On the one 
hand, the entity claims "love" for his followers, and on the other 
hand, with the slightest offense, this "love" can damn one to eternal 
burning and torture in a "lake of fire." This is very alien to say 
the least. The Old Testament books, especially Genesis and Exodus are chock full of crimes against humanity such as the mass murder this entity perpetrated even against his own on a whim. For more in-depth information, please visit 
<A HREF="../../../satanslibrary.org/ExposingChristianity/YHVH_Murderer.html">Jehova: "A Murderer and a Liar from the Beginning."</a>

<P>Nearly everyone familiar with UFO's and aliens, knows that the Greys and Reptilian races of ETs are have little if any emotions. Also, it is recorded in the Judeo/Christian Bible, when “Moses” asked to see "God's" face, the alien replied that no one could see him face to face [Exodus 33: 20-23]. Obviously, this being does not resemble a human being. This also includes the program of Islam where followers are forbidden to paint, draw or use images living characters in their art.  

<P>Many of us have seen Satan. He has nothing to hide. Satan and his Demons, [as well as some of the "angels" 
of the Christian Bible and their cohorts] are of the alien race known as "Nordics." Aleister Crowley's "Illustrated Goetia" published by 
DuQuette, Hyatt and Wilson, second edition, &#169; 2000, has 
numerous illustrations. The illustrations of "Lucifuge Rofocal" 
and "Vassago" show beings with large bulbous heads. I have met with and I have seen Lucifuge Rofocal. He has a large 
bulbous head. He is obviously a hybrid of Grey. He is friendly and 
has emotion, as a hybrid mix is unique. Lilith told me Lucifuge Rofocal has been with them for over 10,000 years. Valefor also is a Grey-Nordic hybrid. He has the large head, with a greenish complexion. Clistheret who is a female is the same.  I have never seen Vassago, but the illustration in the book supports what many of us have seen. There are some hybrid Greys who have sided with Satan, but as a rule, one should never trust any Greys, unless one knows for certain they are with Satan, as Greys are enemies of humanity.  
<P>
Enemy Nordics are frequently seen accompanied by Greys. These Nordics are hostile to humanity. Azazel told me "they are abominable" [referring to the Greys, 
when I asked about them when communicating with him on a Ouija Board]. 
<P>

I strongly suggest those of you who are skeptics to read:
"The Day After Roswell" by Colonel Philip J. Corso, US Army, retired &#169; 1997. The author exposes the 
entire story, with names, dates, facts and documents released under 
the freedom of information act. He was personally in charge of the 
Roswell files under the Army Research and Development at the Pentagon 
directly under Lieutenant General Arthur G. Trudeau.
<P>
Corso explains the reality behind the "Cold War" where the USA and 
the USSR amassed nuclear weapons capable of destroying the Earth five 
times over. If either side employed these, mutual suicide for 
the entire planet would be the result. The truth is, both world powers were 
well aware of the alien threat, which in reality is a hostile one that 
threatens the life of everything and everyone on this planet. This is the reason human attempts to establish any meaningful contact with these entities have met with evasion. 
<P>Both the USA and USSR worked behind the scenes to develop defense 
technology, not to be used on each other, as the media falsely 
claimed to shape public opinion and to delude the masses, but to be 
used in defense of the Earth from a potential alien attack. This was 
also the main reason for the Apollo Moon Mission in 1969. This mission was not just space exploration. The Defense Department was interested in 
establishing a base on the Moon that would act as a reconnaissance 
post for the Earth. The large number of satellites orbiting the Earth also serve the same purpose, for that of protection. 

<P>
The point is- we were successful in deterring them physically, but not psychically. Their strong telepathic influence is felt. The Christian religion and its cohorts provide these entities with the psychic energy they need. Close examination of the Roswell craft and the autopsies performed on the five Greys who piloted the delta shaped UFO revealed their parasitical nature.

<P>The description of the entity called the "ALL" in the book "The Watchers" by Raymond E. Fowler, also supports the parasitical nature of these creatures that are mostly devoid of emotion and how they thrive on the energy of souls. These creatures have tampered with genetic engineering and alteration to where they no longer have any genitals and they cannot reproduce normally through sexual intercourse. They have also tampered with their brains and they lack emotions and physical strength. They are highly adept at telepathic communications, though. Their mouths are very atrophied as they no longer use them. 

<P>
The examination of the alien craft revealed no controls, no on/off 
switches or visible circuits, only depressions shaped as the aliens’ hands, like a hand print in wet cement outside of Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. These were where the aliens placed their hands, becoming an integrated part of the craft. They navigated the craft by using their 
own bioelectricity, powerful telepathy and telekinesis.  
The adjustable bands they placed on their heads to navigate the craft acted as thought amplifiers. 
<BR>Army officers upon examining them, placed them in position on their heads and the devices 
induced vivid colors, hallucinations and resulted in "searing 
headaches." In addition, they found that these bands stimulated various areas of the brain.

<P>In regards to nuclear bombs and this sort of advanced technology, it is the agenda of these human-hating aliens [they are behind the Christian and Muslim programs and the root of Judaism] for humanity to be annihilated through nuclear warfare. They have worked relentlessly to destroy the White Race that descended from Satan and the Original Pagan Gods when they took human sexual partners. Any advancement in civilization for humanity has resulted in alien Grey attempts to corrupt and destroy it. 

<P>
The book “The Watchers" by Raymond E. Fowler is very revealing concerning the alien Grey involvement in the Christianity scam and exposes "The One." 
*See <A HREF="../../../www.luciferianliberationfront.org/borg.html">"Jesus of Borg".</a>

<P>
Most people are unaware of the higher purpose of Satanism. The 
Earth has been the target of a soul farm.&#178; Satan is the "Liberator of 
Humanity."  
<P>
Christianity and its related programs are a hoax. Satan and his Demons are 
here to help us get out from under the position of being 
used as energy livestock in a slaughterhouse for alien consumption. The 
enemy Nordics who saw no use for humanity, <A HREF="garden.html">following the completion 
of the mining project, [for more information about this, please click here]</a> sought to follow a plan and have us all 
destroyed. The “Nephilim” that "took wives" and taught humanity, such as Azazel 
and Set, were banished, cursed and condemned. 
<BR> <img src="Set.gif"><BR>[The above illustration depicts Set teaching a human how to use 
a bow and arrow]. <P>
We are dealing with entities that have extreme psychic power, very advanced technology, and superior knowledge and much more intelligence than we do. They don't age as we do, as they have both the knowledge and technology and some have modified their DNA. Satan is over half a million years old. One can only imagine that to continue learning, experiencing life and empowering one's self for even 1,000 years, the level of knowledge and ability that would be reached. Just combine that with extremely advanced technology to get an idea of where they are at. 

<P>
For those of you who believe in spooks and are skeptic, I strongly 
suggest you read the above books, along with "Extra-Terrestrials 
Among Us" by George C. Andrews. "The Day After Roswell" reveals 
everything from the cover-up, to the promotion of yellow journalism 
stories to the real truth behind the "Star Wars" of the Regan 
Administration and some aspects of the "Cold War."
<P>
<P>
For many years, these spiritually ignorant and deluded New Age idiots 
have been whining repeatedly concerning the "sins" of humanity and how 
we are a threat to the universe with our nuclear weapons and our 
aggression, while all those extra-terrestrials are so goddamned 
pristine and wonderful. They claim the ETs spy on our military and weapons 
bases out of a “altruistic concern for all life in the universe” as we 
have become a threat to them resulting from our “sinful ways.” WRONG.
<P>
These aliens have kept our defense systems under surveillance to see where we are at and just how vulnerable we are to a mass invasion. Top leaders of both the USA and Russia both know this. These aliens have continually and aggressively acted to prevent us from space exploration, jamming our launch vehicles, satellites, causing mechanical problems and even preventing a few from being thrust into orbit. They have acted to jam our signals with buzzing and other electronic intervention. They have been shooting across our radar detectors, creating blips and encouraging our air force to tail them, as they are testing the speed of our aircraft and our maneuverability. They want to know exactly where we are technologically. These Greys played cat and mouse games, and edged ever closer until there was a response. They have also attempted to disrupt worldwide communication and our defenses through electrical and magnetic field interference. 
<P>
Their employment of night vision devices would have been an advantage. The US Defense Department now has these and many other military technologies that are a threat to them. The USA and Russia planned that in case of an alien attack, only half of the Earth would be sacrificed, if one nation was knocked out, the other could cover. 

<P>
General Douglas McArthur remarked to the New York Times in 1955 that 
“the threat comes from out there.” "The nations of the world will have 
to unite for the next war will be an interplanetary war." 

<P>I also want to add here that the alien Greys, who are controlled by the ET race known as “Reptilians” have their own people here who are working for them, many unknowingly, but they can be identified. Because of the programs of Christianity and Islam, psychic ability in the human populace has atrophied and become dormant. Those who have some of this ability have through the centuries been labeled as “witches” and have been heavily persecuted and many times tortured to death and mass-murdered. With psychic ability one can see there is a huge difference in souls. Not all souls are the same and with the “second sight” one can detect an enemy soul.  

<P>During the Second World War, alien spacecraft was prolific. Many air force fighters from both sides reported seeing them frequently. The Axis Powers vs. the Communist Powers. Never before in the history of humanity had war ever reached such a level. Christianity is a stepping off point and a preparation for communism. Satan lost a battle, but not the war. This is far from over. 

<P>
An alien base was seen on the Moon by astronaut Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 fly-over and landing. Mercury 7 astronauts as have many others been tailed by UFO's. "They didn't just shadow or track our aircraft in orbit; they buzzed us and tried to create such havoc with our communications systems that NASA more than once had to rethink astronaut safety in the Mercury and Gemini programs." The Apollo moon-landing program was ultimately abandoned because there was no way to protect our astronauts from alien threats. 

<P>
"The alien spacecraft were also aggressively buzzing our frontline defenses in Eastern Europe, either looking for blind spots or weaknesses; probing our radar to see how quickly we responded.” While never disclosing it publicly, military intelligence analysts supported the view that Earth was already under some form of probing attack by one or more alien cultures that were testing both our ability and resolve to defend ourselves." 

<P>
"Our only successes in defending against them, back in the 1950's and 1960's, occurred when we were able to get a firm tracking radar lock. Then when we locked our targeting radars on, the signals that missiles were supposed to follow to the target, it somehow interfered with their navigational ability, and the vehicles flight became erratic. If we were especially fortunate and able to boost the signal before they broke away, we could actually bring them down. Sometimes we actually got lucky enough to score a hit with a missile before the UFO could take any evasive action, which an Army air defense battalion did with an anti-aircraft missile near Ramstein Air force base in Germany in May of 1974. The spacecraft managed to crash-land in a valley. The craft was retrieved and flown back to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. The Roswell crash was different. There was much speculation that it was a combination of the desert lightening storm and our persistent tracking radars at Alamogordo and the 509th that helped bring down the alien vehicle over the New Mexico desert in 1947." 


<P>
As for the new age focus on love, love, love and three-fold baloney that only serves to promote and to further injustice, [which will eventually cause the collapse of civilization if it continues] and 
everything else that smacks of Christianity, renders those who are stupid and deluded enough to follow it, completely helpless. This also affects everyone else as a whole. The justice system is being rapidly destroyed. Slaves must tolerate abuse and injustice. 

<P>Truth be known, enemy souls here, of which most people cannot see, have been working to protect their own Greys. 
<P>Amdusias told the JoS Ministry in 2003: 
<BR><I>"Just as the enemy has people who cannot see us, we cannot see them. However, they will manifest blatantly as we get closer to the climax of our cause."</I>

<P>They already have and for those of you who are new, Amdusias is one of the Original Pagan Gods, is a Friend of Humanity and is with Satan. 

<P> Satan
and his Demons are trying to help us. Satan is the Liberator of Humanity. The Greys possess tremendous 
telepathic ability and the devices to amplify it. The Christian and related enemy programs are a fraud. People need to wake up to the truth before it is too late.
