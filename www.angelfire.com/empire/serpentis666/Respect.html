I have learned much directly from Satan and our Original Gods. Everything I posted on this website about contacting and establishing relationships with Demons came directly from the Demons themselves. I did not obtain this information from reading a book. 
Everything read from books concerning Demons was wrong information. Most of the information about Demons in popular books was taken from old grimoires written by Jewish rabbis and a few Christians.
<P>
Azazel came to speak to me and he told me the Demons are really upset about the disrespect Father Satan has received, even from his own people. They are not impressed with LaVeyan “Satanists” [most are atheists] and those who attempt to use Father Satan like some sort of servant. Unfortunately, many people come to Satan after experiencing the negative and spiritually destructive influences of other so-called “religions.”
<P>
We do not have to do a full ritual when we want to contact Father Satan. I pray to him every single day and thank him for all he has done for me. He always hears me and responds to me. I cannot over-emphasize the importance of establishing a very close relationship with Satan, for here is where you will learn and grow. The closer I become to Father Satan, the more I am inspired and in awe of him. There is so much spiritual richness and fulfillment when we make Satan the center of our lives. 
<P>
For those who are new, it is important to put aside everything of your past and get to know Father Satan without any assumptions.
