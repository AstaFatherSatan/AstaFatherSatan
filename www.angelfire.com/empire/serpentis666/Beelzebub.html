BEELZEBUB is also known as BAALZEBUB, ENLIL, BEL, "PIR BUB"* BAAL ZEBUL
and BEELZEBUTH<BR>He is also known as the Goetic Demon "BAEL"

<P>Those who are close to Beelzebub know he is Enlil. This is from him personally. Enlil was the original "Bel" which later evolved into "Baal." "Baal" means "Lord," "Master" "Baal the Prince." Beelzebub/Enlil was a very popular and well-known God who had cities named after him with the prefix "Baal" all over the Middle East. <P>Most people who have 
studied the occult know he is very close to Satan and they both go back to the 
"beginning of time" here on earth; Enlil and Enki. He is Father Satan's 
half-brother. Along with his brother Ea/Satan and Astaroth, he wound up in the grimoires as one of the Crowned princes of Hell and was labeled as "evil," as were our other Pagan Gods.  

<P><I>"Baal Zebub, the Healing God of Ekron, later became one word--Beelzebub--which came to represent evil and idolatry in the New Testament of the Bible."<BR>-Excerpt taken from- "Syria" by Coleman South, 1995</I>

<P> Beelzebub is best known as the God of the Philistines, 
He ruled over the city of Ekron. He is second in command to Satan. The Ancient Philistines worshiped Him under the 
name "Baalzebub." Beelzebub is "Lord over all that Flies". Wherever he was worshipped, he was known as God of the weather and meteorology. He also controlled the 
airways when the Nephilim came to Earth. His name was perverted by the Hebrews to mean "Lord of the Flies." <BR>Beelzebub takes care of in-fighting 
between dedicated Satanists. Satan wants unity and Beelzebub enforces this. He 
can be very strict as Satan does not approve of dedicated Satanists cursing each 
other. <BR>Beelzebub is the Patron of all of the Orient [Far East], Martial Arts 
and Asian Culture. He was Prince of the Seraphim and He has a raspy voice.

<P>My experience- I saw him for the first time when I asked for his assistance in creating this webpage about him. He appeared to me with platinum blond hair and darker eyebrows, wearing a white robe. This was the first time I saw him. I heard his voice a long time ago and it was raspy, but when he spoke to me recently, the raspiness was gone. This is probably because he is now free.

<P>Beelzebub's Sigils:
<P><table><tr><td valign="top"><A HREF="Beelzebub_15207.gif"  border="0"><img src="Beelzebub_15207.gif" width="250" height="300" border="0"></a>
<td valign="top"><A HREF="Beelzebub_26400.gif" border="0"><IMG SRC="Beelzebub_26400.gif" border="0"></a> 
</table>
<table><TR><td valign="top"><IMG SRC="Beelzebub5.gif" border="0">
<td valign="top">The Egyptian hieroglyph for "air" and "wind" is very similar to one of Beelzebub’s Sigils. The evolution here is obvious. My point is Beelzebub is "Prince of the Air." I find it sickening how the enemy has denigrated our Gods and claimed Beelzebub is "Lord of the Flies." Many Jewish written grimoires have illustrations of ugly flies for Beelzebub, along with their monstrous images for our other Gods. 
</table>
I have also noted many times in my studies, there is little if any real information about many different ancient peoples, such as the Avites whose God was Adramelech. All I found was in the Judeo/Christian Bible where the Hebrews brutally invaded and mass-murdered them [genocide], as with many other Gentile peoples. The ancient libraries that were razed to the ground not only contained occult and spiritual knowledge, they also contained history. 

The above is a blatant example of history deliberately destroyed and replaced with lies. 



<P>Along with Jewish and Christian destruction of ancient knowledge, nearly all knowledge about 
Beelzebub was lost. Christians were at liberty to blaspheme, malign and slander the 
reputations of the Original Gods any way they saw fit. Since there was no 
opposition left following the razing of cities, mass murder of "Heathen" 
peoples, destruction of their temples, libraries and records, new generations 
had no other sources to turn to for information other than the Judeo/Christian bible 
concerning these Gods. 

<P>Beelzebub/Enlil, was the Patron God of Nippur, a city in Sumeria which is now 
present day Iraq. <BR><IMG src="Sumerian_Map.gif"> 
<BR>Beelzebub had his ziggurats, shrines and temples located in his city, 
Nippur. Below are photos of the remnants of his temple. The fortress on top of 
the mound was built by American excavators in the 1890's "to protect them from 
the local tribes." Beneath is the Great Ziggurat of Nippur and Temple of 
Enlil:<BR><img src="nippur16.jpg" width="550" height="350" valign=center> 
 
<P>Beelzebub/Enlil is the God of storms, atmospheric conditions, the wind, the 
rain and the element of air. He is also the God of Entomancy. Entomancy is a method of divination by interpreting the behavior of insects. Beelzebub is also a Master of Astrology and the Zodiac. <BR>His number is 50 
<P>His ziggurat of Nippur was called, "Fi-irn-bar-sag." He is the God 
who hurls his thunderbolts and lightning against the enemies of Satan. [More 
than one Christian church has met with disaster on occasion]. He is considered to be 
a gracious life-giving and life-sustaining God, taking care of his people, the 
beasts of the field, the fowls of heaven and the fishes of the 
sea. "Enlil [Beelzebub] is both a God of war and God of peace; 
a destroyer and protector, defender, restorer, upbuilder; inimical, hostile and 
most gracious." &#185; 

<P>To enjoy his blessings one must enter into the right relationship with him and Satan. He carries out and enforces Satan's decrees. 
<P>"Enlil [Beelzebub] is neither afraid nor stands in dread of an enemy. A 
battle undertaken by him is pursued with unrelenting vigor till it is carried to 
its victorious end-- with him there is no pardon nor retreat: <BR>The hostile 
not subservient land- from that land thy breast thou dost not turn. <BR>If his 
anger is once aroused, there is no one who could induce him to leave or cool 
off."&#178; 
<P>Enlil/Beelzebub was a "protector and life-giver." "As furious and destructive 
Enlil may be in his dealings with the enemies, as gracious, kind and loving he 
can be when his own people and country are concerned. He protects his people 
from hostile invasions by surrounding them and their home with a high wall or 
by becoming for them a fastness or house, the bolts of which he fastens 
securely so that the hostile hordes can neither climb over or overcome it nor 
can enter through its gates."
<P>"If his people are in need of rain, he opens the gates of heaven, pulls back 
its bars, loosens its fastenings, removes its bolts that abundant rains may 
water their fields; or he may do this to drown and utterly destroy the 
enemy."
<P>Below is an Ancient Sumerian hymn to Enlil/Beelzebub:&#179; 
<P><I>The gate[s] of heaven <BR>The bars of heaven <BR>The fastenings of heaven 
<BR>The bolts of heaven <BR>Thou openest <BR>Thou pullest back <BR>Thou 
loosenest <BR>Thou removest</I> 
<P>"He sustains the life of both man and beast. In doing so, he does not neglect 
even the smallest and most insignificant who maketh to sprout, the grain art 
thou."
<P>The ancient Babylonians were amazed at Enlil's loving kindness, protection 
and support, praising him by exclaiming "He who protects [gives support]." 


<P>Endowed with extraordinary powers and authority. The emblem of his authority 
is a pure or bright scepter which he carries or holds in his hands or wields. He 
acts on the authority of Satan. This bright scepter is, however, not merely 
an emblem of authority, power and might, but also a stylus in the hand of 
Beelzebub, the scribe, by means of which he writes the will and enters the 
decisions of Satan. 
<P>"The twelve signs of the zodiac, the year, seasons, months and signs of the 
zodiac have each and all their beginning and end, their boundaries or outlines, 
their pictures or drawings: Enlil [Beelzebub] indicates and proclaims them. 
There is a meaning and significance to each and all of them: Enlil [Beelzebub] 
interprets them. This he does by the 'fullness of his 
manifestations.' 'Enlil and His Seven Manifestations.' It is one of the most remarkable facts
in connection with the nature of every god who, at one time or another, played the
role of the “Son” in a given trinity, that such a god was considered to have “seven
manifestations” of his powers.' 'Seven' they were, because
this number expresses the 'fullness, completeness, totality.'"<SUP>4</SUP><BR>*These are the chakras

They claim he was the God of King Ahab. <I>[Reference: Devil Worship 1919 by 
Isya Joseph, page 40]</I> 
 
<P>The following is an Excerpt from “Encyclopaedia Biblica; a Critical Dictionary of the Literary, Political and Religious History, the Archaeology, Geography, and Natural History of the Bible" 

<br>Volume I : A-D 

<br>by The Rev. T. K. Cheyne, M.A., DD 
and 
J. Sutherland Black, M.A. LL.D. 


<BR>New York, The Macmillan Company; London: Adam and Charles Black, 1899 


<P>"BAALZEBUB  taking Zebub or Myla as the name
Fly-God, a God
of Ekron, whose oracle was consulted by
Ahaziah king of Israel in his last illness. The name is commonly explained “Lord
of Flies.” True, there is no Semitic analogy for this 
but Pausanias  tells us of a God who drove away dangerous
swarms of flies from Olympia, and Clement of
Alexandria attests the cult of the same God in Elis and we may, if we will, interpret the
title  “A God who sends as well as removes a plague of
flies.”  Let
us however, look farther.
Bezold  thought that in an
Assyrian inscription of the 12th cent. B.C.E. “Baal-Zabnbi” was the name of the one 
of Zebub. Baal-Zebub was a widely
known divine name, adopted for the God of Ekron.
The restoration of the final syllable, however, is admittedly
quite uncertain, and the reading Baal-Sapuna
[see BAAL-ZEPHON, I] seems much more probable.
Winckler, therefore, suggests that Zebub might be
some very ancient name of a locality in Ekron [no
longer to be explained etymologically], on the analogy
of Baal-Sidon, Baal-Hermon, Baal- Lebanon. No
such locality, however, is known, and Ekron, not any
locality in Ekron, was the territory of the Baal. It
is, therefore, more probable that Baal-Zebub, “Lord of Flies” [which occurs
only in a very late narrative, one
which has a pronounced didactic tendency], is a
contemptuous uneuphonic Jewish modification of the
true name, which was probably Baal-Zebul, 'Lord of the
High House.'"

<P>"This is a title such as any God with a fine temple
might bear, and was probably not confined to the God
of Ekron. 'High house' would at the
same time refer to the dwelling-place of the Gods
'mountain of assembly' in the far
North. There is
some reason to think that the Phoenicians knew of such
a dwelling-place. The conception is implied in the
divine name Baal-Saphon, 'Lord of the North' [see
BAAL-ZEPHON], and in the Elegy on the king of Tyre
[Ezekiel 28 ]; and the Philistines probably
knew of it. At any rate, the late Hebrew narrator or,
if we will, an early scribe may have resented the
application of such a title as 'Lord of the high house'
[which suggested to him either Solomon's temple or the heavenly dwelling of Yahwi, to the Ekronite God, and changed
it to 'Lord of flies,' Baal-Zebub. This explanation throws light on three proper names,-
JEZEBEL, ZEBUL, and ZEBULON,
'from thy [high house] of holiness and glory.'
The same term could be applied to the mansion
of the moon in the sky."
