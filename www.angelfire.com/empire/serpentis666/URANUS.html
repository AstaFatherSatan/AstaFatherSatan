<a href="PlanetUranus.html">ABOUT URANUS [Link]</A>
<P>Uranus is a generational planet. The slower moving planets, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, when in the signs are generational in that they influence entire generations of people, rather than being more personal and individual. Their personal influences are in the houses they occupy, not as much in the signs, unless Uranus is the chart ruler or co-ruler and/or is conjunct an angle, and is interpreted a bit differently. 



<P><BR>URANUS IN THE SIGNS

<P>Aries<BR> 
The Uranus in Aries generation brings new knowledge regarding science, industry, technology, the military, and advancements in research; is pioneering in the sciences and the technologies, and works to make improvements and introduce new ways of doing things in these areas. Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Alva Edison were both born with Uranus in Aries. Uranus in Aries people also bring about changes in the military, in combat techniques and with weapons. This generation, as a whole, often makes a break from the past in some way. Uranus in Aries unleashes free aggression. I have noted that many of those of the generations born with this placement are often involved in a major war. Those born in the years 1573-1600; the Thirty Years War broke out in 1618, when those born with Uranus in Aries became adults. Many of those who were born 1759 -1767; their lives were directly affected by the US Revolutionary War in the States, and the French Revolution [1789-1799] in Europe. Those born in the years 1843-1850 were affected by the US Civil War [1861-1865], and those born 1927-1934 were directly affected by World War II. 

 <P>Taurus<BR>
What I have noted from this placement is that the generations that have Uranus in Taurus grew up in the aftermath of major economic upheavals, such as World War II, and after the Declaration of Independence. Many families moved to the new USA, and this changed their finances and also their roots [Taurus], following the establishment of the new country. Again, for those born when Uranus was again in Taurus 1850 – 1858, the US Civil War created economic upheaval and this generation born right before that time grew up in the aftermath. When the generation with Uranus in Taurus reaches adulthood, they work to make changes in regards to finances that often replace the established ways of running the economy. When Uranus is in Taurus, there are often issues in regards to property and land. Uranus was in Taurus 1600 – 1607 and this generation made many advances in establishing colonies in the 'New World.' Uranus is the planet of upheavals and changes and when this planet transits Taurus, there are changes regarding property, land, and finances. The generations that have this placement, often become involved in these issues. People with Uranus in Taurus value financial independence. 


 <P>Gemini<BR>
This generation often changes the established ways of thinking and communicating. This generation values free thought. With new colonies being established in the Americas in the early 17th century, this changed communications, making for a longer distance. New information and ideas also came from the Americas during this period. Those born 1858 -1866 were the first to have access to the newly invented phonograph and telephone, as adults. There is originality in the ways of thinking and with ideas. The 1941 -1948 generation manifested in the hippie movement along with other groups who were in opposition with the established ways of thinking. 


 <P>Cancer<BR>
This generation, many of which were hippies, lived in communes. Uranus in Cancer brings untraditional ideas regarding the family and home life. These people often break from and resent parental authority and authority in general. The influence of Uranus in Cancer can also bring breaks and separation within families. Many people moved to the Americas from all parts of the world, leaving their families behind in other countries.
