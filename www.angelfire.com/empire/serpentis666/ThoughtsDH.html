I was reading HP Maxine's updates, and got to thinking about what it would be 

like to 

be in Father's shoes. Think about this for a minute, especially those of you 

who are 

parents. This breaks my heart! So he creates us, gives us tremendous abilities 

and 

loves us to know end. Teaches us. Just like WE do to our kids. Then, his kids 

(us) are 

taken from him, the enemy tries his best to kill us, and then Father gets the 

blame! If 

you are a parent, just think about this for a second. Someone breaks into your 

house 

violently and kidnaps your kids. Then, kills as many as he can and makes the 

rest 

suffer. Now, not only are the kids TAKEN from you by force and mistreated, the 

kidnappers teach the kids that it is YOUR fault! so now, the kdis that you love 

so 

much HATE you. What a fucking mess. I know Father doesn't need my sympathy, 

but 

I can't help but feel saddened by the way I used to treat him, and even more 

saddened 

by the treatment he has received. Think about this for a while. Another notch 

in my 

hatred for Jehova.
