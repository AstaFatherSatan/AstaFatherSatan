Astrology, when interpreted accurately, is the most detailed and advanced method of divination and is essential to timing rituals and working magick. Nearly all of the ancient megalithic structures were designed to observe the stars and their movements. The four cardinal points used in ritual are based upon the points of the Zodiac, as are the elements. One's astrology chart is a map of his/her soul.  
<P>
The Gods referred to the planetary tables as the "tablets of destiny/fate." One interpretation of the number 666 is 6 x 6 x 6= 216. 2,160 years is how long it takes the synetic vernal point to travel through a house of the zodiac. This is the time of an astrological age. "666, is the number of a man" Aquarius, the water bearer. This will be the Age of Aquarius, the age of fire, the Age of Satan.
<P>
Astrology is a very detailed and advanced subject, but is well worth the time and study. Most of those who call themselves "astrologers" never advance beyond the elementary level. Most of the mainstream astrology books available are elementary and this makes astrology look bad in the eyes of the public. Many of the books available only tell you about the various *methods* of interpretation, they are unable to interpret the information, so they are useless. When an author writes about "growth," this is a cover-up for "I don't know." A competent astrologer will reveal events in the life. 
<P>
 
Important points:
<UL>
<LI>Learn the 12 signs of the zodiac 
	<LI>Learn the symbols 
</UL>
<P>Be careful what you believe when learning astrology, if something doesn't apply to you, more than likely it won't apply to anyone else.
<P>
I have been honest in all my interpretations. Astrology is different from other forms of divination. Astrology goes deep and reveals many things, some which may be unpleasant to say the least. Astrology is brutally truthful and will more than likely change the way you look at life, as it has done for me. I have studied and practiced astrology for over 35 years. Much of what I have learned has been through suffering.
<P>
As for fate vs. free will, I have found knowing about something before it happens, can sometimes give us an edge in preventing it. If you see bad times coming, working to alter the negative energies with consistent applied power meditation, and keeping your energies high will often sublimate the negative planetary influences. Knowing the effects of the planets is a tremendous help in understanding what is occurring in your own life and in the lives of others. 
<UL>For example:
<LI>Know why bad times and unfortunate circumstances are occurring, and when they will be over with.
<LI>Know when a love relationship is significant. 
<LI>Know ahead of time regarding major life changes and how they will affect you.
<LI>Know the influences of the planets so you can make informed choices. 
</UL>
 
<P>
WHAT ASTROLOGY CAN DO FOR YOU
 
 
<P><UL><LI>Know ahead of time the way the energies in your future will turn. Knowing this will give much insight into the actions you take at any given time. Obviously, you don't want to go out and do anything illegal when Saturn will be transiting your 12th house [possible jail time - I am not advocating anything illegal here; I am just citing an example].
 
<BR><BR>
<LI>Use the timing of the universe to assist in your magick. This will work in your favor. For revenge rituals, when Saturn transits the first house of the offending one or when it is retrograding over his/her personal planets[both of these are the worst time in anyone's life], life will already be hard, use this energy to make it worse or to direct it. 
 
<BR><BR><LI>Do You want to now what pleases your lover sexually? The placement of Venus reveals a lot about the love/sexual preferences. 
 
<BR><BR><LI>Do you want to know someone better than they know themselves? Look at their birth date or better yet, his/her astrology chart. 
Through astrology, we can understand what is going on in our lives and have a better understanding of significant others and ourselves. Astrology explains why people do the things they do. 
 
<BR><BR><LI>Astrology will give you knowledge and power over others. 
You can find out if people are lying to you, cheating on you, in love with you, hate you and much more. 
 
</UL>
<P>The down side is knowing about unpleasantness before it happens.
 
Sometimes we see tragedy in other's charts or in our own. People who can't have children, disastrous marriages, unrequited love, and even death.
 
<P>When you really learn to read the planets, it opens another dimension. Sometimes, things don't always manifest the way we read into them. It is important and *ethical* that you do not reveal anything tragic to others you read for. Satan is ethical and Demons teach us ethics. There is always the possibility it may not happen the way we expect it to. If I see disaster, I tell the person I am reading for to be careful at that certain time.
