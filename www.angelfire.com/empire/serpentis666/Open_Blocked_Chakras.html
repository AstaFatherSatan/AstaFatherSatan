<P><BR><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=3> Usually, one's base chakra is open. A burning sensation or feeling of intense pressure in one of the chakras usually indicates the one above it is blocked. For example, some people experience a burning in the throat, which indicates the 6th chakra is blocked. Energy is trapped and cannot ascend through the next chakra. Though there are several different ways, vibration is the most effective means of activating and opening a chakra. 


<P>1. Chakra Breathing.
<UL>
<LI> Inhale and breathe either white-gold light or color energy into the blocked chakra. The energy should be the same color as the chakra you are working on. I have found the white-gold light to be very effective. Both can be used simultaneously. 

<BR><BR><LI>Hold your breath for a count of six and visualize your chakra engulfed in the light or color.  

<BR><BR><LI>Exhale and brighten and expand the chakra

<BR><BR><LI>Inhale through your base chakra brilliant white-gold light and direct it up your spine and through the chakra you are trying to open and direct it out your crown. 

<BR><BR><LI>Exhale and visualize your chakra bright with the white-gold energy and expand it. You can also vibrate the mantras given below during your exhales. 

<BR><LI>Repeat the above exercise several times. You can do this as many times as you are comfortable with. 
</UL>

<P>2. The most potent way is through vibration. 
<UL>
<LI>Base Chakra: Laum, vibrated as LLAHHH – UUU – MMM*
<LI>Sacral Chakra: Vaum, vibrated as VAHHH – UUU – MMM
<LI>Solar Plexus '666' Chakra: Raum, vibrated as RAHHH – UUU – MMM**
<LI>Heart Chakra: Yaum, vibrated as YYAHHH – UUU – MMM
<LI>Throat Chakra: Haum, vibrated as HAHHH – UUU – MMM
<LI>Sixth Chakra: Aum, vibrated as AHHH – UUU – MMM
<LI>Seventh Chakra: Maum, vibrated as MMAHHH – UUU – MMM
 
</UL>
 
<P>* The U's are pronounced as in the English word 'BLUE' 
<BR>**Roll the 'R'
<P>

<A HREF="Runic_Kabalah.html">Runes can also be used</a> and/or certain vibrations in Sanskrit will open your chakras very fast. Focus on and vibrate [aloud] into the chakra you wish to open, while visualizing a white-gold powerful energy upon the chakra. The THOR rune is very effective for opening stubborn areas. The working needs to be repeated every night, preferably during a waxing moon- from new to full. 
<P>
Eventually, the 
chakra will be strong enough to naturally take up energy on its own. Strong 
chakras can absorb energy. Weak chakras that are blocked are depleted and unable 
to attract and absorb energy on their own. Weak and blocked areas create 
diseases associated with the particular chakra and visa-versa- diseases create 
the weak chakra. 
<P>Choose one of more of the above exercises and do it/them daily until the problem is corrected.
