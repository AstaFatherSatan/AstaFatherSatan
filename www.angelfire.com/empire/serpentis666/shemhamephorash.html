There are many Satanists who mistakenly believe "shemhamephorash and its variant spelling "shemhameforash"" mean "Hail Satan." This sort of thing has been promoted by Anton LaVey's Church of Satan, and is no different from their version of the Hebrew letters surrounding the Baphomet [the circle traditionally, when surrounding something, has been used to bind]. The "Leviathan" is a Hebrew word for Hebrew power. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Psalm 74:14 
<br>Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</blockquote>

<p>The above verse is symbolic of the power the Hebrews received from their "God." 

<P>In addition, the Hebrew name "Levi" like "Cohen" is exalted in Hebrew in the way of being descended from the Levi [Jewish priestly] tribe, and being given special duties in the Hebrew temple.  The word "Shemhamephorash" is not Satanic, this is stupidity. "Shem," "Ham" and "Japheth" were sons of the biblical "Noah." Any idiot can see the connection. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Genesis 5: 32 gives Noah's sons in the exact order as the wording of the "Shemhamphorash."
"And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Like everything else in the bible, the story of "Ziusudra" was stolen, corrupted and with this corruption, the name "Noah" replaced "Ziusudra." The name "Noah" is false and represents the enemy "God." Also, we can see this is a Judeo version of the "trinity."

<P><I>"Shemhamephorash" "The 72 part name of God." A divine name of 216 letters derived from Exodus 14: 19-21. Each of the three verses used contains 72 letters which are then arranged in boustrophedon to produce the 72 syllables of the name."</I>&#185; 
<P>Shemhamephorash was eventually condensed to YHWH, the Hebrew version of the tetragrammaton*- meaning the Judeo/Christian "God."
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Exodus 14:
<BR>14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: 

<BR>14:20 
And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night. 

<BR>14:21 
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 
</blockquote>

<P>To obtain the name- the three verses are written in Hebrew with alternating lines in opposite directions, giving 72 columns of 3 letters each. These 72 three letter names are regarded to amplify the powers of the tetragrammaton and are divided into four groups of 18, each division ruled by one of the four letters of the name YHVH. &#178; 

<P>Coming from the Hebrew rabbis:
<BR><I>"Hebrew for tetragrammaton, which in Greek means 'the four letters;' YHVH- those constituting the mystic name of God."</I> &#179;
<P><I>The name of "God" in the Jewish religion is deemed so holy and sacred, it is not to be spoken and it is kept secret. Its pronunciation is considered in the Jewish tradition to be an unforgivable sacrilege. YHVH- the English equivalent of the Hebrew letters Yod He Vau He. Outside of the temple, it is pronounced "Adonai" [Adoshem-'my lord'].</I><SUP>4</SUP></p>

<P><I>Christians, most of whom have an inadequate knowledge of Hebrew punctuation and vowel phonetics, substituted for it, beginning with the year 1518, a distorted form of Yahveh; namely "Jehova."</I> <SUP>5</SUP></p>

<P>Other aliases of this Hebrew "God" include:
<UL>
<LI>When he sits in judgement on the human race: "Elohim"
<LI>When he "wars" on evildoers: "Zebaot"
<LI>When he recalls man's sins: "El Shaddai"
<LI>My Lord: "Adonai"
<LI>Most High God: "El Elion"
<LI>Creator: "Ha-Boreh"
<LI>God of Israel: "Elohe Yisrael"
<LI>God the strong one/God the hero: "El Ha-Gibbor
<LI>Yaweh, the god of armies (in English- the lord of hosts): Yahveh Elohai Zebaot
<LI>Holy one of Israel: Tsur Yisrael
<LI>The place (omnipresent): Ha-Makom
<LI>Infinite one of the kabbalah: "En Sof"
</UL>
<P>*The Hebrew version of the tetragrammaton translates into the "holy ineffible name of [the Judeo/Christian] "God," YHVH/JHVH also Yaweh, Jehova. The name YHVH/JHVH literally means, "he is." <SUP>6</SUP> This "YHVH/JHVH" is a corruption and a blasphemy of the <A HREF="../../../satanslibrary.org/ExposingChristianity/Tetragrammaton.html">true tetragrammaton,</a> which are certain points upon the soul. 

<P>The reason I have gone into so much detail is people need to get educated about this. KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING BEFORE YOU SAY IT! Instead of saying "Hail Satan" one is, when saying "shemhamephorash," saying "Hail Yaweh." This is due to ignorance and stupidity on the part of those who promote it.
