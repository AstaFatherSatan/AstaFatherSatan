It has been said many times, "the eyes are the window of the soul." The eyes are the only opening to the brain that is not encased in bone. Through the optic nerve, the eyes are linked to the brain. When we train our minds and elevate our bioelectricity, we can directly mesmerize other people by just looking into their eyes and catching their gaze for several seconds. 

<P>How this is done: 

<P>1. You must have a strong willful mind, capable of controlling others who are weaker. 

<P>2. The closer you are to the person, the more effective this technique. This takes practice. 

<P>3.  You have to concentrate and project your bioelectricity along with your intentions out of your own eyes into the other person's. 

<P>a. Sit in front of a mirror and relax. Look up for about 1-2 minutes, this helps to get you into the alpha state. Deepen your trance as deep as you can go. 

<P>b. Focus into your own eyes in the mirror. Start projecting your energy through your eyes. *When training, do not focus any negative energy upon yourself for obvious reasons! 

<P>c. You should start to feel your own energy, as it is reflected back through the mirror. Do this every day and your energy will become stronger. 

<P>d. When you feel powerful and you are confident enough, you can try this out on other people. Animals are also very susceptible. You will be able to stop an attack dog in its tracks. 

<P>5. When mesmerizing someone, command this person, in your mind what it is you intend for him/her to do, experience, etc. The same goes for curses that should be delivered with maximum hatred and intensity. The commands should be a short phrase. Animals communicate through mental images. 

<P>6. Look deep into his/her eyes, almost past them into the back of their skull, directly projecting your energy into their brain to do your will. Focus intensely. 

<P>This is a very advanced skill. You can also practice with a close or trusted friend, as long as you keep the energy positive. Negative energy will cause harm, so don't play around with this. 

<P>This skill takes often years of consistent practice to become adept to where your stare, in just a few seconds will put others under your control.
