Unfortunately, the Christian Church has worked relentlessly to remove knowledge, suppress freedom of the press and free speech, and attack Satan. Satanism is a major threat to many who wish to retain control and power as Satanism places control and power in the hands of the common people. Satanism has been deliberately and viciously attacked for centuries and followers have been severely persecuted. Enemy programs that masquerade as so-called "religions" have been free to promote their own lies and horror stories about Satanism to keep people away, by using a lack of knowledge along with fear. This has lead to much ignorance and confusion concerning Satanism and has had a most unfortunate effect on many who have had misunderstandings along with no one to answer their questions when seeking Satan. 

<P>Satanism is VERY spiritually intense. For those of you who were raised in Christian homes, or were atheists, this intensity of spirituality can be surprising or even come as a shock. Enemy programs such as Christianity and Islam are spiritually dead; in other words, nothing happens, and on the rare occasion something does, it is of a weak nature. Programs such as Christianity are based upon stolen and false practices and the spirituality was deliberately removed. As opposed to Christians who pray and keep praying with no answers, Satanists get blatant answers and I don't mean twenty years later!

<P>Many of us have had similar experiences as Spiritual Satanists, but we are all individuals. Experiences will vary, and what one person may experience, another may not. This all has to do with how advanced your soul is in this lifetime. Those who meditated regularly in past lives, regardless of who they are, are more open and psychic than those who never worked at these disciplines. 

<P>For those who are new, here are some of the things you can expect: 

<UL>
<LI>Strange and frequent coincidences, usually of a positive nature. 

<BR><BR><LI>Voices that may give you good advice or inform you of something you didn't know or something that will happen. Please be aware that the voices of our Gods [Demons] DO NOT give us negative prophesy. When we begin meditating, we open our minds and souls to the astral. How open we are in this life depends upon the strength of our soul coming from past lives. Just as Christians and Muslims force their lies and programs onto others; this is no different from the spirit world where enemy spirits who are behind those programs can harass us, especially those of us who are more open psychically. These entities are human-hating and are known for giving negative prophesies. They are also prolific liars. Upon doing the dedication to Satan, we are under his protection. When we open our minds, we are more sensitive to the astral world, which is very real. There are numerous articles on this website that give effective advice in regards to controlling this sort of harassment in both the spirit and in the material world. 

<BR><BR><LI>Vivid dreams, especially if you have been studying a lot about Demons.<BR> Usually these dreams aren't negative, just vivid and intense. </UL>

<P>Many things happening early on can be stimulating and exciting. Remember this is something new and can take some getting used to, as you are establishing strong, permanent spiritual relationships that will help you immeasurably.

<P>Now, at some point, usually when you are feeling somewhat confident, Satan will more than likely show you what is wrong with your life. Satan knows everything about us and where we are headed by our actions, lack of initiative or whatever the case may be. If we are doing something that will have a detrimental effect on our lives down the road, he will often let us know, blatantly. Consistent meditation also brings awareness and we will notice and see things that most others are oblivious to. 

<P>This can be bewildering and even downright frightening to some, especially with all the lies and false horror stories spread by the enemy for centuries. There is no cause for alarm. He is only getting onto you because he cares. Sometimes he will send a Demon to direct us, as he did with me and I am to this day, deeply grateful. The Demon might get strict or do whatever will get you to listen up and change.

<P>NEVER WILL SATAN OR HIS DEMONS TELL YOU TO DO ANYTHING HARMFUL OR DETRIMENTAL TO YOURSELF OR OTHERS! These kinds of experiences come from Christian angels and other entities that have nothing to do with Satan or any of our Gods/Demons.

<P>Always remain open. If you are having problems understanding something or are confused, you can ask Satan to help you and he will. Remember, ALWAYS show respect and reverence for Satan and our Demon friends and they will reward you with much wisdom and knowledge that outsiders will never have.

<P>The so-called "supernatural" is often a part of our daily lives as Satanists. This is something positive. Satan will reward you with a sense of spiritual and inner strength that will pull you through anything. Psychic gifts begin to open to us more and more, along with confidence and deep understanding.

<P>In finishing, it is important to keep a strong positive attitude and don't listen to bunk and the false stories told by those who know nothing about Satan, or Satanism. 
<BR>Satan's Blessings to you, and may your journey in Spiritual Satanism be rich and rewarding.
