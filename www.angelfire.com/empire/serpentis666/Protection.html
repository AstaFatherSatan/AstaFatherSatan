This meditation is very important. It is
simple and the more you do this, the more powerful the protective aura
becomes. 

<P><BR><P>1. Breathe in white-gold energy* as you would
with the <a href="Foundation_Meditation.html">energy foundation meditation.</a> You don't need to go
into a deep trance with this. Just concentrate on *feeling* the energy enter your
being on each inhale and then visualize a powerful brilliant light, like the
Sun becoming brighter and brighter with each exhalation. Once you get this
going, it becomes very easy and takes little time.
<P>2. Affirm: "I am breathing in powerful
protective energy. This energy is building an aura of protection around me.
This aura protects me at all times in every way." 
<BR>Say this to yourself five
times for five inhales. After this, just concentrate on visualizing and feeling the energy, making it more and more brighter and powerful. <P>This will program the energy and also program your
aura. 

<BR>After several days of doing this exercise, you can say the affirmation
once or twice, instead of five, as it will already be programmed into your
aura.
<P>The more you do this, you will build a more and
more powerful protective aura. Use the energy from the Sun as well.
Energy from the Sun is extremely powerful.
When doing this, just add "I am breathing in powerful protective energy
from the sun. This energy is building an aura of protection around me. This
aura protects me at all times in every way."


<P>*White-gold energy is used because it is
reflective.
You can also program your aura so you
breathe in protective energy from the Sun (extremely powerful) when you are
outside. After the first few times, you don't even have to visualize
anything. You can just feel this and you don't have to be in a trance for it
to work- you will feel it. I am to where I just consciously breathe in
energy and I can do it easily at any time- with no trance or visualization.
<P>Another important thing you can
do to protect yourself and remain safe is to affirm 5-10 times before you go
to sleep:
<P>"I am always totally safe and protected in
every way."
Never doubt this!
The aura of protection will also help to
clean your aura and repel any negative energy. This is very important.

<P>You can also visualize loved ones and breathe energy into their aura to protect them. Just go into a trance and visualize whoever you want to protect and breathe in energy as outlined in the link above and then breathe it out into the aura of the one you wish to protect and follow the same procedure, only apply it to this other person. This can also be done for healing purposes.
