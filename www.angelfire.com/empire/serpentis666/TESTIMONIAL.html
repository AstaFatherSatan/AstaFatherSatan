*Please note, this webpage is very, very old. In the <A HREF="Groups.html">e-groups,</a> we have had thousands of positive testimonials regarding Satan. Due to time restrictions and a very heavy work load, I havent been able to add them. 


<P><IMG SRC="BlackBar.gif">

<P>I have not had the pleasure of being a practicing
 Satanist for a large
 amount of time. I came here from xian
 ministry, but
 believe me when I
 say that I knew nothing of real love until I got
 here. You see to know
 love one must know hate. I spent years trying to
 love without
 acknowledging hate. In that action I was denying
 my
 own humanity and
 running contrary to the All.
 
  
<P> I
 was amazed that the
 minute I let go of everything Father Satan
 immediately filled me with
 so much love and warmth I was lead to tears. It
 was
 incredible.
  
<p> Please remember my brothers and sisters that we
 know
 the love of Lucifer
 and the joys that it brings us. We have the
 Knowing
 and are therefore
 truly blessed. When we love someone it is paying
 homage and respect to
 Lucifer because he is the source of true love. May
 we always remember
 this love because it will carry us through the
 good
 times and the bad. May we remember this today.
<p> Darkest Blessings to us all,
 -Rev. "Zen"

 <P>My life has done a complete turn around and I 
finally have the peace inside that I have been looking for the past 
37 yrs of my life. I always had an uneasy feeling when my parents 
would drag me off to church like something was very wrong with what I
was hearing! I hope what I am trying to say makes since to you 
because I don’t really know how to explain how much better I feel and 
how much clearer everything around me seems. – Jim

<P><IMG SRC="BlackBar.gif">

<P>I performed the ritual and dedicated my soul to Father. I have never felt better in my life! Right away I felt different, everything seems much clearer now. 
<BR>Hail Satan! <BR>–Steve 

<P><IMG SRC="BlackBar.gif">


<P> Ever since I came over to Father, I feel my life has only gotten better. He has always helped me when I truly need help and he has sent his Demons to also aid me. Some times people are looking too hard for answers that they are blind and can't see Father standing right in front of them. 
<BR>Hail Satan! 
<BR>–Warlock

<P>I am a 17 year old male. I was raised catholic and quickly learned what the blessing of "god" felt like. When I first came to Satan it was because I took way to much cocaine. One of his spirits appeared before me and cleansed me of it completely, and I haven't touched drugs again. Immediately I started working with the Goetic spirit Sitri. I was amazed at how much he knew and how polite he was. The most recent thing he's helped me with I consider very serious. My girlfriend, who I have strong feelings for and connect well to, had mentioned the Tarot saying she would be in a car accident about this time in her life.
<P>
 My third eye was going crazy all night, and I couldn't quit thinking about how I would feel if she died. Later that night my girlfriend and I were playing pool and I asked Sitri to protect her. He surprised me by agreeing to do this. I had always consulted him about love. We were running later than normal that night and something told me to smoke another cigarette, even though I had too many that night she smoked one with me then dropped me off at my house. On the way home she saw Sitri sitting in the passenger seat, where I had been. He told her to drive safely. Soon after seeing him, the car in front of her got into a head on collision and smashed badly. One minute earlier and that could've been her. 
<P>
My moral is this: Father Satan is the best father, and Demonic friends are the best friends. I have given several things to Sitri for his help and thanked father Satan daily that I'm not somewhere more painful now. I've only been Satanist about a two years and I've seen more evidence that it is true than several years of xianity. Oh yah, Father Satan's blessing, it's much more beautiful and powerful than anything I've experienced in my life. HAIL SATAN! Thank you Sitri and HP Maxine! I am grateful.

<P>I'm a 38 yr old SWM artist. I found LaVeyan Satanism when I
was 19, and while I will always be grateful for his writings
and hints of knowledge he gave, within several years I 
realized there was something more out there than either he or
I suspected. One morning, while watching the dawn, Satan
came to me, and in one glorious moment I knew, I just knew
he was there and he was just and he was good. Now this is
not to say that since then all has been easy, but when
tough love was needed it was given. If I persevered and
prepared, I was able to take advantage of the opportunities
he presented me. If I was slack, the opportunities still
came but because I didn't listen I lost out. He never said
"I told you so!", but I learned none the less. <BR>Hail Satan! 
<BR>–Felbac

<P><IMG SRC="BlackBar.gif">

<P>When I first came across Joy of Satan,
I was skeptical and sometimes I used to feel terrified just reading the pages 
for no reason at all. It was pure fear & terror, I couldn’t explain it. Then 
I read that jehova & company use that tactic to scare people away from Satan, 
so in this way my fear left me. Then dedicating my soul was another problem, 
I just couldn't do it. I kept putting it off for later on and tried to forget 
about it. Then another friend of mine got confirmed and I felt something in me 
tell me to do the same, so I triggered up the guts to do it and the night I 
got confirmed it was about 2:30 am, I was still having second thoughts then 
suddenly I felt my room filled with a kind of energy, EXTREMELY POSITIVE AND 
FULL OF LOVE. I felt that many people were in my room with me and that they were 
encouraging me to do it and that is what gave me the guts to sign my name in 
blood. It was a very strange feeling... but you know for some reason the names 
Beelzebub & Astaroth kept coming to my mind at that time and I realized that 
they were encouraging me in my decision to dedicate my soul, and I LOVE THEM 
for it. One thing is for sure, Satan will always 
help you evolve your soul, he'll tell you what to do and how to do it. He did this 
for me even before I confirmed (he knew that eventually I will confirm) so you 
see.... here we have a Loving God who looks after us even before we dedicate 
ourselves to him. The main thing is to keep yourself open. <BR>Hail all Demons
<BR>Hail Lucifer.

<P>Greetings all,
Yes Father is wonderful!
He healed me just recently.
I had problems with my liver for the past year and a
few days ago I got my blood test results showing my
liver was now within the healthy range.
It was never anything serious but it always stressed
me a little since I’m only 23 and my liver is kinda
useful to me! :)
Father knows when we are not well and he is always
there for us.
<BR>Hail Father!
<BR>Dark blessings, –Bill

<P> Greetings all, I was out in the desert this weekend visiting my mother, and
 about an hour after I arrived   I realized I had left a seven day
 candle burning on the mantle. This is not the safest thing to do
 with kitties running about the house! I was very nervous they
 would knock it over and burn down the house. I found a private
 spot and talked to Father and my personal Demon about my
 fears, asking them to protect my home and pets. When I arrived
 at home I found the candle was out! Not burned out, for it still
 had about 2 days to go, and the wick hadn't fallen in. There was
 no  mundane reason that  it would have stopped burning. It
 seemed to have been put out carefully and deliberately. I feel
 Father and my Demon came to my rescue. It's such a great
 feeling ! I hear how often people pray to the Nazarene and
 nothing ever changes and they get no help. I am so thankful to
 have found Father! Many, many thanks to Father and my Demon!
<BR> Hail Father Satan!
 <BR>Darkest Blessings to all!

 <P>Father Satan has brought me to tears many times. He
 has shown me love and caring that I have never had
 before. Some time ago, when I was rather new, I
 hadn't
 been able to see 2 of my kids who live in another
 state for close to 3 years. This has been one thing
 in
 my life that has torn me up. Finances and their
 father
 were an obstacle. I was so deeply touched when
 circumstances miraculously allowed me to spend over
 a
 month with them here where I live and everything
 went
 so well. 
     <p> We all have our own personal problems, mine has
 been I have gotten hard to the point where I just
 don't care. When I was an atheist, this was to an
 extreme. After I became a Satanist, I was having
 some
 problems and I was mad and could care less whether I
 was dead or alive. Father showed me something the
 next
 day, it was death and the stench and it was hideous,
 I
 saw this and it made me sick. This was particularly
 grizzly. He was showing me that he cared about me
 and
 that I should care more about life and myself.<p> I
 cannot tell you how this touched me and what it
 meant
 to me. He has shown
 me so much
 real love and caring. There are so many things he
 has
 done for me. I rarely ask for anything, he takes
 care
 of me. <br>–HPS Maxine
<BR>*Recently, he brought me together with my family and blessed us with a house.   
<P><IMG SRC="BlackBar.gif">


<P>I came from a catholic background, but it was only
recently that I converted to Satanism. I stumbled upon
HP Maxine's website by chance while I was feeling down
and depressed. I do admit it wasn't really a good time
to turn to Father Satan just like that. However, I had
been searching for answers all this years, which many
xians just claim, my faith is weak, I should pray
more, etc, not to mention the feeling of self-guilt,
self blaming tendencies which caused me to have a low
self-esteem.<P>

One only has to look closely to find that many xians
teachings do contradict each other. However, I would
only hope people would come to meet Father Satan in an
open-minded manner. This advise was given to me by HP
Maxine and it's true.
<BR>The least to say, Father had given me a warmth and
wholeness which I never felt before. Liberation is the
word here. At least now I know the meaning to live
one's life with dignity and honor.
<BR>Give yourself and Father Satan a chance. Though I am
relatively new, I had never regret doing so."
<BR>Dark Blessings!! <BR>–Mark

<P>When I gave myself to Father Satan, my life improved immediately. The money I have spent on my ritual tools has come back to me five fold. When I want something it seems to come to me, more often than not. It seems a cloud has been lifted from my mind; I am no longer in a haze... I know what I must do and when I must do it. He has comforted me when I have been down and He has given me hope and strength like I never knew possible. Giving my soul and life to Satan is the greatest thing I have ever, or will ever do. Before I was nothing, but now there is nothing I can't do. With Father by your side you can do anything. Obey Father and always love and respect Him and you will know the meaning of happiness, you will become much stronger, and you will never have to fear the xian piece of shit, joke of  a god, because Satan is the true King. <BR>HAIL SATAN!!!
<BR>– Steven

<P>  
The night before the last I was on my back meditating. I said a very 
sincere prayer to Satan asking for his anointing, blessing, 
empowerment, protection and knowledge. Suddenly all the pieces of my 
life fit together perfectly. As if that wasn't wonderful enough 
Father came to me. When I saw my girlfriend and everything as the blessing 
it is, I thanked Father Satan. As soon as I thanked him, I heard a 
rattle shaking. With every shake of the rattle, my altered 
state went deeper. Suddenly I heard the hiss of the serpent. Father 
had come to me in the form of a serpent. When he came to Adam and Eve 
he was the serpent, and came to tell them they could be like Gods.... 
right? This is what I think... it was kinda an acknowledgement. 
 By this point my aura was twice as strong, my feet felt like they 
were on the earth - drawing in sooooo much energy, my chakras were 
radiant, my spirit was loosened, my mind was clear. Just then Father 
took the form of the most beautiful bearer of light, and gently put 
his hand on my back. The room changed colors several times- from 
purple to blue to green. This feeling was not comparable to any drug 
or emotion, it was simply beautiful and indescribable. I again 
thanked Father and meditated on all that had just happened.
I'm really overwhelmed by it.

<BR>HE IS THE MOST HIGH
<BR>HAIL SATAN!!!

<P><IMG SRC="BlackBar.gif">

<P>I would like to share this, as I'm aware that there are those of you who are not dedicated to Father. Dedication was most wonderful experience I had in my short life. Father LOVES US, I personally love him MORE then myself (which isn't "normal" but never mind :)) If I wasn't dedicated I would most probably be dead by now. Although there was something that was protecting me throughout my life, once I was dedicated, I immediately received a response from Father.<P> While I still had depression, I  asked "Father Lucifer, have you left me as well??" After that, I FELT most wonderful energy in my life. I believe that was Father's energy that was every millimeter in my body. I was depressed, after that I start to laugh, cry, and sing. It was BEAUTIFULL experience. I rarely cry as I'm "cold" person, but whenever I THINK about Father my eyes get wet, and I can FEEL his love and presence. I still cannot imagine or even "rationally" explain his love for us, for his children. <P>I believe the key is - show Him your emotions, open up your heart. I do not trust hardly anyone in my life (as I had very fucked up life), that was when "I was without". Now I know that there's one I can trust 10000% - Father Lucifer.<P>
After my Dedication, I realized TRUE meaning of term "without.” I dedicated one and half months ago.  It's incredible that fucked up drug addict, which was suffering from manic depression (this is most powerful form of depression - very suicidal); I tried to kill myself several times, which for obvious reasons, didn't succeed). I didn't see a purpose of my life, I thank Father every day and night. I can see him in EVERYTHING from air I breathe, through soil I walk on. Life has meaning again, everything is clearing up rapidly, my individual strength, and self-confidence are increasing even as I write. I'm in bliss states all the time. I never had crisis or withdrawals after I quit using drugs. My 'normal' dose was 9 pills of etc, or at least several lines of speed. It's amazing that I'm still mentally and physically well and functioning. I'm so full of energy that my hands are sweating. I'm very sorry in doubting in Father, but that was my natural reaction, as I was...without. All of this is NOTHING compared to what I FEEL. Right now, I'm sweating and crying as I'm thinking intensely on Father and what he did for me.<P> I prayed for my mothers health (she's without), and suffering from angelic attacks, they are all around in my house...not in my room though. She had very much trouble in obtaining meditations that are necessary for her spinal cord to get better (she was shot in the spine, therefore quadriplegic - she cannot move and she's suffering cancer-like pains). Two fucking days after praying for her health, she received MEDICATIONS that (I cannot stress this) wore almost IMPOSSIBLE for her to get, as we live in Serbia. She was trying to get them for 3 years! Although, I am an American citizen (from my fathers side), I couldn't speed this up.<P> She'll also be operated very soon.  She agreed to do a healing meditation. There's so much more, I could write a book. I believed Father was acting by "seen" ways, I know I was wrong. He acts through unseen ways (at least for us who are not spiritually opened - yet!), that's a FACT!  After my dedication, I had a perfectly clear vision in my head, I saw myself, alone, in darkness..."without.” I asked Father did he accept me. I heard wonderful music, and I saw people that were dancing and celebrating around me. I know what this means. I wanted to post this as I dedicated because other's experiences had a strong influence on me. I hope nobody will mind because I opened my heart.
<BR>Thank You Father!
<BR>–Rev Leon

<P>DEMONS

<P><BR> When I first 
started practicing magick and Demonolatry, I couldn’t figure out why 
nothing was happening and I started to grow impatient, but then 
after talking to elders of my group, they told me that everyone goes 
through that. It does take practice. It’s not something that you can 
just mess with here and there and expect it to work. It takes 
persistence. With me, I just kept trying and trying, 
then when I saw something happen and I saw that it was no fairy 
tale, I didn’t want to ever stop. So many people have came to me and 
said, "well I've been trying these rituals and nothing is happening", and 
then they just want to give it up. You shouldn't let yourself get 
discouraged, Just keep on trying.  <BR> Praise Hell, Hail SATAN!  
<BR>–Jeremy
<P><IMG SRC="BlackBar.gif">

<P>Two days back, I prayed to Father for 
the first time ever... I asked him for a favor in the afternoon and 
instantly got it as a blessing from him by evening... Well, in the 
night when I went to sleep at about 9:00 pm. I woke up round about at 
3:00 am in the morning to have a glass of water... After I was done, 
I went back to lay down on my sofa to go to sleep... I guess it was 
just 5 minutes that I must have laid down over there and I'm sure 
that I wasn't fully asleep when I saw a short man (4 feet tall) with 
a French beard turn up from somewhere who said to me "Father 
Lucifer's great man!" and he ran away... I wasn't scared or anything 
so I went out in the corridor to look for him but he had disappeared.

<P>
  Lucifuge Rofocale Comes Through With the Cash!!!
 <BR>I am an artist.  
 I like to paint. 
 Recently I have been into depicting Demons or
 other
 nasties more like re representing them to add my
 own
 flare to their existence and to re-introduce them
 to
 the world. Thus far, I have done a painting to
 Bael,
 Lucifer, and I am currently finishing up one on
 Lilith. One of the ways I was hoping to prepare
 for
 a
 painting was by summoning or making some form of
 contact with the being in question. I have been
 pretty successful so far without venturing into a
 heavy dramatic ritual environment. Conversation
 prior
 to bedtime and during random quiet moments during
 the
 day have proved sufficient enough to obtain
 imagery
 and insight into the subject and the being in
 question. Anyway... I have been wanting to do a
 painting of Lucifuge Rofocale for some time and so,
 recently I have been looking into various magick
 texts
 for ways to call him up. And since artistic
 embodiment is one way in which the being can be
 paid
 back for a favor I thought "hell if I was going to
 do
 that anyway I might as well get something for it."<P>
 So
 I began figuring out a pact to make with him. I
 figured money is a good all round thing to ask
 for. 
 So at times when I 'felt connected' to the
 universe
 (I
 have no other way to describe it). I would voice and
 mentally make contact with whom, to me, would be
 Lucifuge Rofocale.  And without going into an
 elaborate
 ritual I received a $500.00 holiday bonus in my
 paycheck
 and I had only been working there for 3 months! 
 Whether or not one would say that my pact idea had
 anything to do with it or not, I feel that the
 timing
 was too nice to not relate the two. Now I realize
 that
 I did not make a formal pact or ritual evocation
 but
 I
 guess after having multiple successes throughout
 the
 years with having wants and wills manifest without
 any
 ritual or spell having been done that my methods,
 at
 least to me, work and are valid.  Anyway, I am now going to pursue a painting of Lucifer Rofocale in
 order to pay homage and thank him. <BR> ~Lucifer 9

<P><IMG SRC="BlackBar.gif">


<P> I thought this was pretty cool. This was my first time that I 
 called 
 upon a Demon for help. I set up the ritual and when I put his 
seal 
 on the altar...never even spoke out his name and a huge wall of 
 wind 
 went through my room....very cold.  It blew wildly for at least 3 
or 
 5 
  minutes. I made sure it wasn't my central heat/air...nope it 
wasn't! 
 The air from my vents doesn't blow this intensely! My candles were 
 all 
 going in the same direction, but never blew out. I don't know 
how 
 it 
 kept from blowing any of the candles out. I called out to him 
and 
 gave him my prayers...I felt so content, yet a tad bit on the cold 
 side. I took this as a good sign that everything will be okay.  
I 
 told him that I would acknowledge him in many ways....GUSION 
Thank 
 you again...I know I made a new friend.<BR>–Lez
