There is a sub-atomic particle, discovered in 1956,
called the neutrino. This particle, because of its
extremely tiny size, and elusive behavior is difficult
for scientists to study. The missing 9/10ths of the
universe is thought to be comprised of neutrinos and
neutrino-like particles. Although neutrinos have mass, they
pass right through physical matter. It has been
estimated that a neutrino from the sun would stand a
good chance of penetrating a thickness of lead
stretching from Earth to the nearest star without
colliding with anything.
<P>
 
Recent developments in physics, astronomy, and
neurology provide an unexpected breakthrough into the
understanding of psychic and paranormal phenomena. The
atoms of our physical bodies contain the much
finer and faster vibrating neutrinos and neutrino-like
particles. These finer and faster vibrating particles
compose the substance of the soul, that is joined to our physical body by a magnetic cord
that breaks at the moment of death. The soul breaks
loose from the body when the body is no longer able to
function as a home for it. 
<P>
When one applies one's self to consistent <a href="Satanic_Meditation.html">power meditation,</a> one's chakras vibrate at faster speeds. This
takes training, preparation and readiness, but
through the higher speeds, approaching the speed of
light, one is able to access other dimensions at will. 
 <P>Humanity currently
resides in a lower dimension. This has much to do with
our earth and its position in space. In higher dimensions, colors, shapes, sounds, and thoughts are
more vivid. One can see through walls and have the
sensation of omnipresence. Telepathy is extremely
enhanced and other senses become much stronger and
more open beyond anything most people have experienced. 
<P>
