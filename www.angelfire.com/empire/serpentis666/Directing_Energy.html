To make full use of your abilities in magick, it is important to be familiar with energy; sensing it, how to absorb it, detect it, send it out and manipulate it. This comes with meditating, sensitizing yourself to it and working with it. With consistent practice, power meditation will naturally increase your bioelectricity. You will be able to feel this energy often, just by being aware of it. Awareness is the key to advancement in ability and power. This exercise works best after doing hatha yoga, mantra or any meditation that gives you an energy buzz. 
<P>
1. Lie quietly and become aware of the energies on the left side of your body, then your right side. 
<P>
2. Direct the energy from side to side and then bring it from both sides to meet in the middle of your torso. You do this by focusing your mind and concentrating on the middle of your torso, or anywhere else you want the energy to go. You should almost immediately feel energy in the middle of your torso. Wherever the mind is focused with intention, the energy will follow there. 
<P>
3. From here, expand the energy past your body and into your aura and then contract the energy. Focus your attention to your aura [the energy field immediately outside of your body].  
<P>
4. Continue to expand and contract the energy until both sides of your body feel balanced. Then feel the energies on the left and right sides together. 
<P>
5. Feel energy from the front of your body, then the back, repeating the same steps as described above. 
<P>
6. Do this again, this time from the waist up, then from the waist down. Same as above. 
<P>
7. Now, feel the energy in your entire body as a whole. Practice expanding and contracting your aura several times. 
<P>
8. The last time, bring the energy together in the center of your body and gently expand it out, expanding your aura, making sure it feels balanced and even. 
<P>
9. Meditate on feeling the energy gently radiating and expanding your aura for a few minutes. 
<P>
This is an excellent exercise for directing energy at will.
<P>
It is very important to always direct your energy upwards and out of your crown chakra. There will be times you will feel it drifting to your legs and feet. It should not remain there for any length of time as it can create problems because of a lack of circulation.
