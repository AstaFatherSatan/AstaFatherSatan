<LI>Sit in a comfortable chair or lie down on a comfortable spot and relax. 
<BR><BR><LI>Imagine and will, with each inhale, not only your lungs are breathing, inhaling air, but also your whole body is breathing in energy. You inhale with your entire body. The breath acts as a focus for absorbing energy.
<BR><BR><LI>
Know that along with your lungs, each single inch of your body simultaneously absorbs energy. Like a dry sponge when dipped into water absorbs, your body should absorb energy with each inhalation.
</OL><P>
Since everyone is individual, how each of us feels the energy will be different in some respects. 
 
<P>
To reverse this, exhale energy out. This can make you tired and shouldn’t be done regularly other than to get a grip on how to do it. 
<UL><LI>Exhaling energy is for empowering talismans, charging sigils, healing- anything, and everything when you want to put energy into something or to direct it. 
<br><BR><LI>
Energy can also be inhaled and absorbed and then directed to a specific area of your body for healing. 
<br><BR><LI>
In a very short time, you should be able to feel the energy when you breathe it in. As you advance, you will be able to see it without trying to visualize it. 
<br><BR><LI>
Feeling in this exercise is most important, especially when you are new. Do not try to see the energy as this can be a distraction. Just get a feel for it. 
<BR><BR><LI>This exercise is the most important for working with your mind and manipulating energy, which is the foundation of all magick. </UL>
<P>
As you advance, you can use this technique of energy absorption to absorb energy from the Sun and from just about anything you choose.
