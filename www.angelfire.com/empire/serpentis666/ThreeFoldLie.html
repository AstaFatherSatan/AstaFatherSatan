The "Three-fold," the "Ten-fold," The One-hundred-fold&#148;; all of these were
invented by a few human beings to frighten the masses, in order to maintain
spiritual control. With the availability of knowledge in modern times, witchcraft
could no longer be suppressed, so the oppressors had to find a way to keep it
inline so real power and control can remain in the hands of a few. These few
*know* the truth and are adepts in black magick which they use liberally to
spiritually enslave the masses. They control the mainstream religions that are
nothing but programs to suppress knowledge and control humanity. The article
below exposes this lie for what it is:
<P>"The first known reference in print to the three-fold law of return appeared in
1970 in ’Witchcraft Ancient and Modern’ by Raymond Buckland who was initiated
into the craft by Gerald Gardner and was instrumental in introducing Gardnerian
Witchcraft into the United States." [1]

<P>
With enough research, it is evident that the "three-fold" emerged with the
"Gardnerian Tradition." Then, we have the "seven-fold" and I’m sure everyone
has heard of the "ten-fold." My point here is none of this recent man-made
nonsense has anything to do with the original religions. Its sole purpose is to
keep people from using their inborn power and to promote a passive attitude that
is accepting of abuse. This is no different from the Christian Church.

<P>This "three-fold teaching was taken from the eastern concept of "karma" after it
merged with Western Christianity. After the eastern teachings of karma picked up
the Judeo/Christian overtones of divine punishment, the product evolved into yet
another system of control with the same theme of keeping power in the hands of
a few who know how to use it to exploit humanity. One thing led to another and
Gerald Gardner added more to this and promoted the belief that witches must
never use their powers to cause harm. Everybody has to take abuse and keep
the passive attitude. 

<P>The Wiccan Rede: "An it harm none, do what ye will." According to Gardner, the
"creed" is derived from "Good King Pausol" who declared, "Do what you like so
long as you harm no one." King Pausol is a fictitious character from the French
novel by Pierre Louÿs (1870-1925): Les Adventures du Roi Pausole: Pausole
(Souverain Paillard et Débonnaire) (1901 and reprinted in 1925 numerous times
since), or the Adventures of King Pausole (The Bawdy and Good Natured
Sovereign). This is the basis of "Wicca." Wicca is nothing more than a
Christianized version of the old religions. Wiccans have taken selected rites and
teachings to suit their whims, from the original religions and have twisted,
corrupted and transformed them and are now passing themselves off as the
original religion. The hypocrisy can be readily seen in the Gods they
acknowledge. Many, if not most of these Gods and Goddesses that they claim to worship, were the ones who brought the teachings of magick to humans, both
white and black magick. They are known as "The Fallen Ones." 

<P>The original Horned God is Satan. In addition, few Wiccans bother to do any indepth
research regarding the Gods and Goddesses they commune with and
worship. Most of these deities are of the Pantheon of Hell. Many Wiccans and
modern Pagans also unknowingly mix their deities (Angels with Demons) and
this can spell disaster. I read a long list of deities these people claim to worship
and it is obvious they really know nothing much about them. Most of these
writings consist of nothing but double talk, for example: how "Ishtar" should be
evoked instead of "Ashtaroth" even though they are the same Goddess. They
claim using the name "Ashtaroth" is different, even though they readily admit she
is the same Goddess.

<P>
According to author Raymond Buckland, Wiccans claim their religious roots to be
evident in a Paleolithic cave painting of a man dressed in stag skins presumably
performing a dance. "Caverne des Trois Freres at Ariege France" is the site of
this cave painting. It is just that- a man dressed up in animal skins and is no proof
of anything. 

<P>
Satanism has often served as the scapegoat for these new age religions and
movements, whose adherents view themselves as so good and perfect. Wicca is
a Christianized corruption of the old pagan religions. Wicca is the
Judeo/Christianized version of witchcraft. One of the major goals of Christianity is
to destroy the past and replace it with fictitious versions that conform to the lie of
Christianity. Recently, they have been working to turn the religion into a Goddess
cult, by gradually getting rid of the Horned God so there will be fewer and fewer
ties with the original religions. Wicca is a bogus movement, not based upon the
facts, but like Christianity, it is based upon stolen and altered rites and teachings.
Like Christianity, it depends upon the ignorance of its followers to thrive.
