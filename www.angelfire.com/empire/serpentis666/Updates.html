<p>Message from Soaring Eagle 666:</p>
<p>This is an offline mirror of the Joy of Satan websites. The site layout should be familiar, but I merged the "Satan is God" index page with our old homepage to keep everything more organized. You will find several new links in the left column with pentagram pictures. I put "Reverse Torah Rituals" near the top, as they are the most important. The rest are near the bottom.
</p><p>Over the years, our websites have been repeatedly taken down and put back up, losing quality each time. However, after much careful work, it is now restored. Over a hundred broken links are now fixed, mangled text is repaired, and dozens of long-lost pages are now available. I tried to keep everything at the old location whenever possible, but it was necessary to move/rename some pages, which may break some of your bookmarks. There were multiple copies of some files, even old versions of the same pages.
</p><p>
However, to keep the size of this mirror from being unwieldy, I did not include the Exposing Christianity MP3s (1GB), and I re-compressed the video <a href="../../../kabbalahexposed.com/a_war_from_another_galaxy.mp4">A War From Another Galaxy</a> (100MB -> 37MB).
</p><p> 
<u>Most Notably:</u><br>
<ol>
<li>All three copies of Exposing Christianity are now merged and located here: <a href="../../../satanslibrary.org/ExposingChristianity/EXPOSING_CHRISTIANITY_MAIN.html">satanslibrary.org/ExposingChristianity/EXPOSING_CHRISTIANITY_MAIN.html</a></li>
<li>Both copies of The Black Sun are now merged and located here: <a href="../../../satanslibrary.org/666BlackSun/BlackSunMain.html">satanslibrary.org/666BlackSun/BlackSunMain.html</a></li>
<li>All links to the defunct Yahoo Groups and old forums now link to our ZIP archive of those sites: <a href="../../../satanslibrary.org/GroupsForumsBackup.html">GroupsForumsBackup.html</a></li>
<li>My favorite lost page is <a href="Helloween.html">Helloween.html</a>, which I remember enjoying on the original Angelfire site!</li>

<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">Message from High Priestess Maxine Dietrich:
<br>It is a sad fact that some idiots have nothing better to do with their time and have no real 'life'
of their own, that they have to put energy, time and effort into impersonating me online. 
</font></p><ul><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">
<li>I do not have a "Facebook" page or account, nor do I ever intend to. 
</li><li>I do not have a personal 'Twitter' or anything else related. 
</li><li>I do not SEND anyone personal e-mails, I only REPLY to very few who e-mail me as I simply am too busy and do not have the time. 
</li><li>I do not visit or make any posts or replies in any groups or forums outside of the Joy of Satan.
</li><li>There are NOT any photos of me online. Any pictures that claim to be me are fakes!
</li><li>Anyone who claims to be a child of mine or a relative of mine online is a liar.

<P> The former Joy of Satan Yahoo Groups are no longer functional. We can no longer moderate them, Yahoo has ruined all of these groups. 

<P> Joy of Satan Ancient Forums: <A HREF="https://ancient-forums.com">https://www.Ancient-Forums.com</a> is open to everyone. You don't have to sign up as these are open to the public.

<P>The Lycos/Angelfire server shut down the entire Joy of Satan main website. Shutdowns by servers are nothing new to us. This accounts for all of the broken links, as I've had enough sense over the years not to put everything on one website, but on as many as possible. That way, they don't all go down. We are working to fix these. We are doing everything we can to get everything up and running again. The enemy has attacked us relentlessly upon our exposing them. This includes how they hooked a bomb under my car in 2006. <P>Satan told me April 30th 2004 <I>"There will be many attempts on your life. Most of these you will never know about. NONE of these will succeed. But know one thing: <u>THEY WILL ALL KNOW ME.</u></I>" 

<P>In addition, one morning several years ago, I woke up to voices in my living-room. There were FBI agents conversing with my husband, relating how they intercepted an enemy intent to murder the both of us. 

<P>Getting back to the websites, if you experience looping or if your browser directs you to the angelfire page, you have to clear your cache. It is a sad fact that the enemy is and has been doing everything they can to take control of and ruin the internet. The enemy has had control over 96% of the media for decades. Only since the internet, has there been any opportunities for real free speech. Many years ago, when the internet was fairly new, back around 2002, when I first put up the Joy of Satan website, everything was so different. Everything was user friendly from the Yahoo e-groups to free and easy to use online email. Web servers back in those days were much different as well. Most had readily available HTML coding and other coding, providing user friendliness and flexibility when establishing a website. All of that has changed for the worse. This also includes PCs. Years ago, one could purchase a new PC, bring it home, turn it on and configure it, etc. Now, one must "register" and provide all kinds of demanded personal information to even have any functional access on WHAT ONE PAID FOR. The JEW DEMANDS TO KNOW! 

<P><I>"Just as [YHVH's] people cannot see you, you cannot see them, but they will manifest blatantly as the Earth draws closer to the climax of our cause."</I>
<BR> - Amdusias (One of our Pagan Gods)
<BR>His personal statement given to the Joy of Satan Ministry in the year 2003. 

<P>What Lucifuge Rofocal (One of our Pagan Gods) related to HP Hooded Cobra recently was very alarming. Lucifuge Rofocal's planet was destroyed. They all received the implant. When this flash-over point occurs, all is lost. Lucifuge Rofocal managed to escape with some others. This accounts for why the Grey extraterrestrials have a blatant microchip in their heads that those deep in a meditative state can see when looking into their big bug eyes.
