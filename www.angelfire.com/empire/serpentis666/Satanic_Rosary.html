    <TD>The Satanic Rosary is an excellent and very effective means to 
      raise power and apply energy towards your desires. The Satanic Rosary can 
      also be used as a kabalistic meditation tool for working with vibrations, 
      such as with <A href="Runic_Kabalah.html">Runic 
      meditation.</A> Just slide your fingers over the beads and you don't have 
      to count. Your meditation can flow smoothly and thus have more power. 
      <BR><BR>The Catholic Rosary was STOLEN from Tibetan Mala Beads and 
      corrupted, as with everything else in that foul program. Tibetan Mala 
      beads have 108 beads, as opposed to the stolen Catholic Rosary, which has 
      half that number, at 54. </B>
    <TD vAlign=top><IMG 
      src="Satanic_Rosary.gif"> 
</TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>For working the rosary, each working should begin on a 
favorable planetary period in regards to the goal. The standard for this and 
this is very effective is 40 days straight. For maximum power, twice a day, 
during the day and at night for the 40 days. The "40 days" was stolen and 
corrupted into that filthy judeo/xian bible, but originated in Ancient Egypt. 
This has to do with numbers (Enki/Satan's number is 40) and the moon cycle. The 
most powerful times to do a working ar at midnight, 12 noon, 6 pm and 6 am, BUT 
make sure the hour is supportive of the working, first and foremost as you are 
able to. 
<P>Research has proven that the Ancient Chaldean planetary hours are extremely 
accurate. I strongly encourage you to download the Chronos program from this 
website: <BR><A href="http://chronosxp.sourceforge.net/en/">CLICK HERE</A> 
<P>You will need to download and install version 2.0 of the Microsoft .NET 
Framework along with this. All of the information is available at the above 
website. This program is outstanding and calculates hours of the planets 
specific to your location. Given the results of your workig, if you still have 
not obtained your goal after completing the 40 days, you can begin another 40 
days. Skipping a day will set you back at day one. No days can be skipped. There 
is this thing called "karma" as most of you know. This shit is ruled by the 
planet Saturn and the only way to defeat it is to know it and work to overcome 
it. Karma will give you a beat down and keep you beat down unless you are aware 
of it and are strong and persistent enough to fight against it and overcome it. 
This is not for the weak. Persistance, patience and hard work are required here. 
When past life karma kicks in, things will come up like a crisis in your life to 
try to break the 40 day cycle and to stop you from your meditations. What this 
indicates is that your meditations are working. Keep doing your daily meditation 
with the rosary regardless of what happens. These sorts of things usually crop 
up during the last 30-40 days of the meditation cycle, to try to set you at 
square one again and/or stop the meditation. Be prepared and aware. One must 
keep fighting. Only the strong survive here and attain their goals. 
<P>Energy must be applied over and over again until change is achieved. This is 
analagous to a chiropractor who keeps popping the spine into place until it 
stays where it should be. 
<P>For healing, it is important when there are chronic ailments to go way beyond 
the end of the symptoms, in meditating. The symptoms may stop for a time and 
then return if meditation is stopped. The length of time one has endured the 
ailment means longer times for meditations, sometimes even for months or years. 
Congential problems are the worst and the most difficult to heal. these are by 
no means impossible. They just will require much more power and effort. 
<P>By using the Satanic Rosary, we are taking back what is ours for one, and 
another- blaspheming the Catholic Church. I have found this meditation tool to 
be excellent and that is an understatement. The vibrations flow into a rhythm 
and power is amplified and can be applied towards any desire. 
<P>To use the Satanic Rosary, ideally, you should be working with the Kabalah. 
The TRUE Kabalah is using vibration, for example vibrating Runes, names of 
Demons, Egyptian words of power, etc., to drastrically raise your energy and 
power. This form of meditation is advanced and is extremely effective. 
<P>You can just do the vibrations for raising energy and awareness, or you can 
focus on a specific chakra or aspect of your soul, or you can do spell-working. 
<P>I suggest you make your own Satanic Rosary. They are easy to make. The 
materials are cheaply available in most stores where they have an arts and 
crafts section. Just purchase the beads and the cord. The Baphomet can be 
purchased online or at any well-stocked occult shop. I suggest leaving a bit of 
space on the cord, so you can slide the beads along as you do your vibration for 
each one. I also suggest you place an extra bead (I used square shaped beads for 
the extra beads) on each side of the larger one when you hit 50. That way you 
can feel where you are at without interrupting your trance/meditation. 
<P>To use the Satanic Rosary, here is an example- feel free to modify your own 
meditation to fit your individual purposes: 
<P>FOR ATTRACTING MONEY: 
<P>1. Begin with the larger bead right next to the Baphomet and state your 
affirmation in your mind; example: "I am attracting large amounts of free and 
easy money. This money is free and all mine to keep or spend as I please." Now, 
direct the energy, visualizing a white/gold light (this is all-purpose) on your 
wallet and yourself. 
<P>2. Repeat the above for the four remaining beads. 
<P>3. Your Satanic Rosary should have 108 beads, so one side of the main line 
should end with eight. You want to start with the side that has nine. Breathe in 
and on the exhale, vibrate: 
<BR>F-F-F-F-F-F-F-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-U-U-U-U-U-U-U 
<P>4. Slide the bead back and go to the next one, breathe in and on the exhale, 
vibrate <BR>F-F-F-F-F-F-F-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-U-U-U-U-U-U-U 
<P>5. Do this for each bead in the sets of nine. Visualize the Fehu Rune glowing 
with energy, every so often as you do the vibrations. (If you are vibrating the 
name of a Demon, then visualize His/Her Sigil in the same way. 
<P>6. When you reach the larger 10th bead, separating the sets of the smaller 9 
beads, state your affirmation again and put your energy you have just raised 
into attracing money, as given in the example above. You can also use each 10th 
bead to take a few normal breaths before returning to the vibrations again. 
<P>FOR LOVE/LUST: <BR>To bring a desired one into your life, visualize the 
energy you raise engulfing him/her. You can also fantasize having sexual 
intercourse or whatever with the one of your desire. I suggest you visualize the 
light (energy) engulfing both of you, during the meditation/fantasy. When you 
are finished, you can masturbate and direct more energy from the orgasm into 
him/her. 
<P>TO HEAL: <BR>State the affirmation for healing and then direct the energy 
both by feel and visualization into the afflicted part of your body. If healing 
a loved one, do the visualization and don't forget to clean the afflicted part 
before beginning the meditation. <BR>Remember, with healing, energy must be 
directed along with affirmations to the afflicted part some 10-20 times a day. 
This can take anywhere from 1-2 minutes, but must be done as much as possible, 
any time you can focus, until you are completely healed. <BR><A

for more information about healing. 
<P>FOR BLACK MAGICK: <BR>Use the rosary the same way, to pump negative energy 
into your target. 
<P>IMPORTANT! <BR>For black magick workings, it is very important to use a 
separate rosary. The rosary accumulates energy and can become more and more 
powerful each time you use it. Obviously, contrary energies here can clash and 
cancel each other out. 
<P><BR>I have used the Satanic Rosary for both attaining my desires, and for 
just raising my energies. Working with runes is extremely powerful and during 
the meditation, it is not unusual to see certain aspects of your soul and feel 
the energy aligning itself.
