The pineal gland is the part
of the brain that empowers what is known as the "sixth sense" and other paranormal abilities. It is also the center of bliss sensations. The pineal gland is defunct in the average person. A defunct pineal gland is analogous to a severed
spinal cord where the brain cannot send messages to
move the body parts beneath
the area that has been severed. The only difference is that it affects the soul.

<P>Through the centuries, because of Christianity and its related programs, humanity has devolved and degenerated spiritually. This is why the human race as a whole is psychically powerless. The goal of the Christian Church always has been to keep humanity without knowledge, and without power. Any time the Christian Church took control of an area, the ancient spiritual texts were removed and/or destroyed.  The Church then replaced the knowledge it removed, with lies and a fictitious history. This is why the human race is where it is at today spiritually. Depression, illness, misery, helplessness and ignorance are the results of the loss of this spiritual knowledge.  The average person only uses 5-10% of his/her mind power. This is analogous to a limb that has been immobilized, is in a cast and is stiff and withered, but it is only worse. 
Humanity has been denied access to psychic powers through generations and the lack of use and has all but lost.
In order to activate the pineal gland, power meditations must be must done regularly. It
takes time to empower this gland and to activate it and use it. 


<br>
The pineal gland works in conjunction with the pituitary gland. Both of these glands are stimulated through the <a href="Crown_Chakra.html">opening of the crown meditation.</a> 
<P>
The Pineal and Pituitary adapt and lower the frequency of bioelectrical currents. They are psychic energy transformers. Psychic energy enters through the higher chakras, and descends down through the crown chakra where it enters the pineal gland in the brain. As
it enters the brain, the rate of vibration is slowed
down. An active pineal gland acts as a transformer
that further slows down the energy to a lower
frequency. The energy then enters and moves from the hypothalamus
region of the brain into the pituitary gland. The
pituitary further transforms the energy to an even
lower frequency so that it can be assimilated and read
by the brain.
<BR>Humanity as a whole is operating on a low frequency. Power meditation and spinning our chakras speeds up this vibration to a higher level where we are psychically open and aware. A higher vibration also protects us against illnesses and negative energy.  
 <P>
The Corpus Callosum works to exchange information
between both hemispheres of the brain. Most humans do
not use the right side of the brain, as we live in a left-brained
world. Void meditation silences the left side of thinking and logic, and opens us to the right side, which is the
intuitive/psychic side. 
<P>
Light is essential to the soul. So much negativity has
been associated with light because of the abuse of Christian programs, and the New Age movement. Light is connected
with lightening which is symbolic of the creation and is an age-old symbol of Satan; the
lightening bolt. We can travel on light and use light
for our own purposes.
<P>
Unlike other religions, Satanism and science
work together. We experience, we see and we
understand. Satan explains things. 

<P>Several years ago, I succeeded in activating my pineal gland. The result was a blissful feeling I had never experienced before and this feeling permeated my entire aura. There was a white light that flooded my entire head. I could see this well, in the dark room I was in. I also felt a pressure and a sensation like a grape; a small swelling inside of my head, which was my pineal gland. It was most beautiful. I achieved this through a specific meditation. After achieving an energy buzz, I concentrated all of this energy into a ball and circulated it through each of my chakras and when I reached my 6th chakra behind my third eye, I dropped this energy ball onto my pineal gland, right beneath and a bit to the side of my 6th chakra. I then breathed in energy directly into my pineal gland.
