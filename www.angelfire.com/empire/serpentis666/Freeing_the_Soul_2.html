Many people experience problems in this life that originated in a past life. The following meditation and Sanskrit word of power can be used for liberating the soul from being stuck in certain situations and being bound in different ways and in ridding one of energies from the past which are proving to be an obstacle in this lifetime. 
<p>
As I wrote before, one's present love life can be wrecked and/or even non-existent because of commitments made in one's past life or even lives. This is one of the worst and most powerful, as it often involves sexual orgasm, and love is one of the most potent of human emotions. Many fall deeply in love with another person and vow to 'be together with the other person forever.' Often these vows, whether verbal or unspoken manifest during love making and sexual orgasm, which gives them extra power. The result is because one is not at full power and many other things of life and destiny, fate intervenes and the loved one may not reincarnate into the same future life/lives, but the vow still remains. In order to have any decent love life in this present life, the vow/energy on the soul must be successfully removed. 
<p>
The same can be said in regards to poverty. This is a total game, enforced by the Christian churches for one and all of the so-called 'religions' which have been corrupted with Judeo/Christian FILTH, that preach and indoctrinate their victims into accepting and believing that 'poverty is a virtue' which is a total crock of shit, obviously. The game is further played in that these institutions then serve as a front for 'charitable organizations.' The victim [as is always with these JEWISH programs and games for Gentiles] damns him/herself into a lifetime or even many lifetimes of poverty, so that all wealth and power can be safely and securely kept in the hands of the Jews. 


<p>Quotes from the Jewish Talmud:

<br>Seph. Jp., 92, 1: <br>'God has given the Jews power over the possessions and blood of all nations.'

<p>Schulchan Aruch, Choszen Hamiszpat 348: <br>'All property of other nations belongs to the Jewish nation, which, consequently, is entitled to seize upon it without any scruples.'

<p>Schulchan Aruch, Choszen Hamiszpat 156: <br>"When a Jew has a Gentile in his clutches, another Jew may go to the same Gentile, lend him money and in turn deceive him, so that the Gentile shall be ruined. For the property of a Gentile, according to our law, belongs to no one, and the first Jew that passes has full right to seize it."
<p>
The above then becomes a self-perpetuating vicious cycle, and victims are then fooled into believing that 'Christian Charity' is something positive that 'helps the poor' and those who are suffering because of money issues. Truth be known, no different from the Jews who CREATE the problems in the first place, then they are the ones who OFFER THE SOLUTIONS - THEIR SOLUTIONS to the very problems THEY created in the first place. 
<p>
The endless list goes on and on, from astral bindings and much more to include here, but you get the general idea. I also want to add- one only has to understand the Jews and what they are and HOW they work to fully understand the enemy Greys, reptilians and related angelic filth. What the Jews do, these entities do on a larger level, like the psychic attacks and intrusiveness- not much different from how the indoctrinated Christians relentlessly attack others and push their Christian filth.  
<p>
CHRISTIAN MIND CONTROL 
<p>
One technique Christians have used for centuries is that of mind control. Those who attend Christian services or masses subject themselves to being programmed. One naturally becomes bored and begins mindlessly daydreaming, or even half-nodding off to sleep. This is when one is most susceptible to their subconscious mind being programmed. This is even worse for in the case of small children and even babies whose minds are open and susceptible. In colonial times, church masses lasted all day long. The church usher would carry a long steel pole with a ball at the tip to crack those who nodded off on the head. Church attendance was compulsory, resulting in fines or public humiliation such as confinement to the stocks for a specified period of time if one did not comply. All of this is a conspiracy. The Christian church masses and services are meant to be boring in order to induce a passive and receptive state of mind where one can be programmed without their knowledge.
<p>
Those who control the Christian program know all about the mind and how to program the populace. They are nothing but a bunch of the worst criminals. All of this is done deliberately to create a slave state. The slave state is the goal of Christianity. The Christians who walk around with the pasty artificial smiles as though in a trance are those who continuously subject themselves to this indoctrination. More and more church attendance and reinforcement turns them into conditioned robots. This is one reason many who are in the process of breaking away from Christianity have a hard time, experience confusion and sometimes fear. People are unaware they are actually being hypnotized. Studying the truth will eventually result in deprogramming one's mind. The fear, doubt, and confusion will eventually give way to reason.

Ok, so here is the meditation:
<br>Begin at the waning part of a full moon [from the full to the new phase], a full Satanic rosary should be said, vibrating the word 'MUNKA' 108 times. YOU MUST DO THIS FOR FORTY DAYS STRAIGHT WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTIONS IN THE DAYS!
This is pronounced 'MMUUUUUU-NNNN-YAH-KAH.' I can't put in the Sanskrit lettering here as the yahoo does not support this font. The 'N' is like the Spanish Enyay. The above example for the pronunciation is 100% correct and works wonders. 

<p>For using Runes: 
<p>URUZ, AUROCHS 
<br>Anglo-Saxon: UR 
<br>Germanic: Uraz (Uruz) 
<br>Gothic: Urus 
<br>Norse: Ur 
<br>Anglo-Saxon: Ur 
<br>Icelandic: Ur 
<br>Norwegian: Ur 
<p>
OR
<p>
ANSUZ (God) [Always remember the code-word and true meaning for 'God' is one's self]
<br>Germanic: Aza (Ansuz) 
<br>Gothic: Ansus 
<br>Norse: Óss, Áss 
<br>Anglo-Saxon: Aesc, (Os, Ac) 
<br>Icelandic: Óss, Áss 
<br>Norwegian: As 

<p>See <a href="Runic_Kabalah.html">The Runic Kabalah 666</a>
<p>When you are finished with the vibration, you need to do your affirmation for 9 times. 9 is the number of endings for workings like this. 
<p>For example: Engulf yourself in white-gold light like the sun and affirm:
<br>"I am totally and completely free from [whatever is binding or hindering you]." 
<p>
Another one, for a hampered love life:
<br>"I am totally and completely free and absolved from any and all former vows and ties regarding my love life and extending into past lives." "I am now totally free to have a happy and fulfilling love relationship with whomever I consciously desire in my present life right now." 
<p>
Positive indications that the above working is doing its job is seeing the wings of your soul manifest spontaneously during the working. The wings of the soul are symbolic of spiritual freedom and power. 


<p>A very effective working for money is as follows:

<p>Recite a <a href="Satanic_Rosary.html">Satanic Rosary</a> every day for 40 days straight, using the mantra:
<br>AUM SHRIM MAHA LAKSHMIYEI SWAHA 
<br>AH-UU-MM SH-REE-M MAH-HAH LAHK-SHMEE-YAY-EE SVAH-AH

<p>Begin this working when the moon is waxing, preferably when in the signs of Taurus, Cancer, Leo, or Sagittarius.
In extreme cases, this working may have to be repeated more than once. 

<p>Following the rosary, visualize yourself with money in your hands and plenty of it, while engulfing yourself in brilliant white-gold light, and also the light on the money. Then affirm 9 times:

<p>"I am attracting to myself extremely large amounts of free and easy money. This money is all mine to keep or to spend as I please." 


<p>Note: Don't expect a heap of money all at once. You financial situation should improve gradually with this meditation and over time.
