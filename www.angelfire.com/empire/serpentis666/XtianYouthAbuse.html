<P>When I was a xtian I went to Oakland Heights Baptist Church in East 
Texas. We had an underground church and personally I was one of the 3 
days bound at my wrists behind my back my knees togeather and at my 
ankles I was not alowed to take them off until I underwent a trial 
which happened 4 hours later. 

<P>When we got to the place where I was 
going to go on trial persecuters waited outside the church and 
attacked my whole group the went through our bags taking whatever 
they wanted and throwing away our food we were arrested and thrown 
in "prison" where we all underwent different things. Some people had to 
do pushups in fish gutts leftovers or garbage from restaurants which 
chick a fila provided, had to eat disgusting things such as cat food 
raw onions or saltine crackers until we could barley swallow. Most of 
us were throwing up and crying by then. They even went so far as to 
take hairspray to the girls and empty a can in their hair. It was men 
doing it so they "didnt know" that it could
 cause hair to break off so half the girls went home with chunks of 
hair missing. One girl in our group was even "executed" and forced to 
stay in a body bag and be drugged in trial and used as a threat to 
what would happen if we didnt say no to god. </P>
<P>The point of the 3 day 
event was to go to as many houses and gather people for in our groups 
and not be arrested. We had 2 leaders that were both youth members 
and could really do nothing at all. We were not allowed to stay in 
one place for more than 2 hours and we were not allowed to run from 
the persecutors. It was 3 days I will never forget because of the 
absolute cruelty our youth leaders displayed. It was a disgusting 
sight and by the last day some of us were selected to run a special 
marathon... I was selected. It started out and you had to eat part of 
a raw onion then cat food, drink prune juice then be soaked in 
molasses and covered in galic powder, have ice water thrown in your 
face then slide into chickafila's donations then go and
 actually put your mouth to a large dead fish and kiss it then run 
all the way back  to the begining before vomiting. They say if you 
can do that then god will take you to heaven. Bullshit!! Personally all 
I see from the piece of shit xtian god is the suffering of his blind 
followers which I regret I was ever one of... this was one of my many 
experiences as a xtian before I found the truth. All I have to say is 
its all bullshit. They say humilliation in front of your peers will 
strengthen you. Well fuck them, fuck their "god" and fuck their jesus 
christ
<P> 
HAIL SATAN!!
