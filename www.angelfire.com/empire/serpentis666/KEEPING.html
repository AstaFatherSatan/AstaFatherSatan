In the years 2001-2002, I put my efforts into study, as this is what Father Satan wanted me to do. Money was short, but Father Satan took care of all of my essential needs.
<P>
At the health club I worked at, there was a woman who was a member. She offered to take me to the store and buy me a pair of shoes. The shoes I was wearing were shot to say the least. I had bad feet and the old shoes were comfortable. The problem was this woman was deep into Christianity. She proselytized incessantly. She knew I had no interest in her religion and I told her not to pray for me, ever. I am friendly to people and outgoing and she and I had been friendly towards each other. 
<P>
I got to thinking, this is getting too friendly. She is too Christian and she talks to others about going to church and taking part in other Christian activities. I remembered what Father Satan stated in the Al Jilwah about his not allowing friendly association with Christians and people who are against him. In addition, I have repeatedly seen and read of serious problems whenever one of us associates with Christians.
<P>
I love Father Satan more than anything and in no way will I do anything against his wishes. I said to myself, NO, right there. I don't care if my shoes have holes in them. I don't even care if I am barefoot, I won't go against Satan. 
<P>
Several hours later that night, I found a brand new shoe box. Inside was the nicest pair of athletic shoes, VERY expensive and exactly my size. I put the shoes on and they fit perfectly. I thanked Father Satan for the shoes. I don't know where the shoes came from, as they weren't there before. I have seen Father Satan's miracles before. <BR>HAIL SATAN!!
