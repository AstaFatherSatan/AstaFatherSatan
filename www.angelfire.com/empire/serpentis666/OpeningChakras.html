Opening your soul will open your astral eyes, your astral hearing, your astral touch and other astral senses, along with empowering your soul. Opening the soul will lead you to see the truth and obtain enlightenment. In addition, you will discover many so-called "supernatural" powers within yourself when you empower your chakras. When the chakras are correctly aligned and empowered, the healing of both physical, and mental ailments will often occur miraculously. Please note- some of the mantras have been revised. Once you have completed the exercises listed below, you can repeat them at any time, or as many times as you like. It is best to wait a month after completing these for the first time though, as the effects can manifest intensely days or even weeks later.

</a></td><td valign="top"><span>Azazel who is a Master of Spiritual
Alchemy worked with me in detail on each one of these meditations. These meditations are extremely
powerful and often, the effects can be felt hours later. It is important to follow
instructions and if you are new to power meditation, to go slow. If you have
already done the former meditations, it is fine to do these. Quite a few
people reported little or no effects from the former meditations that were taken
from books. In addition, as of August 2018, quite a few people stated in the e-groups that they were not open enough. I have revised the opening of the chakras with more powerful mantras, and have added an audio Mp3 to hear the correct vibration for each chakra. Please feel free to download any of the Mp3's if you want to keep them. Because the enemy could not completely destroy all spiritual knowledge, much has been deliberately corrupted. The standard mainstream knowledge of the 7 main chakras is corrupt. The "heart" and all references to it is not located in the chest, but in the head, corresponding to the nadis.

</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">It is best to open each chakra as listed by the numbers above. From the top down. 
There are a certain number of repetitions for each exercise. If you find you are
getting over stimulated, it is advised you end the exercise and back off. The
exercise can be resumed at a later date while you give your nervous system time
to adjust to the increased life force. It is strongly recommended to give yourself a
few days or more between each exercise.

</font></p><p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="3">People who have problems with seizures/epilepsy, or who are on psychiatric
medications should not perform any of these power meditations, with the
exception of void meditation, unless given the ok by their physician.
They are
highly effective in opening the chakras and stimulating the kundalini. These new
meditations are filled with Satanic energy. Those who have not dedicated or are
outsiders should give this consideration. For dedicated Satanists, the effects
should be very positive in opening and empowering the chakras and in
increasing personal power.
<br>These meditations produce very rapid results. Standard kundalini meditations of
the New Age variety can take years to have a pronounced effect. These
meditations, like Satanism are the real thing.<br>
Void meditation is highly recommended in order to control the thoughts and mind
that will be stimulated by the opening of the chakras. 

<br><br>The meditations are performed with specific vibrations for each chakra. Each
vibration is based on the Yogic Humming Breath. With this breath, you inhale
to fill your lungs and with the exhale, you vibrate the chant until you are
out of breath, then you breathe in and fill your lungs as before. 

<br>1. Inhale through your nose, filling your lungs
<br>2. Exhale the vibration for each chakra evenly; one long vibration, this will draw out the exhale
<br>3. Breathe in again and repeat.


<br><br>Mudras [hand positions] are used as these connect certain circuits within
the fingers and redirect the life force to the chakra being opened. Some of these are difficult, especially if your hands are larger. <b>These mudras are helpful, but not necessary. If you find any of these hand positions difficult, just leave them out. It is very important to be comfortable and relaxed.</b>
<br><br>You should focus on the chakras in the middle of your body. <a href="Chakras_Diagram.html">Extensions are
along the spine and in the front of the body.</a> Everyone comes to
Satanism on different levels. Those of us who empowered our souls in past lives
will be much more sensitive to the meditations. This is inborn, but anyone who
performs the following exercises will eventually open their chakras.
