There is a lot to be said for performing rituals and magick outdoors. The earth
energies act to enhance one’s inner energy and ability. A quiet place should be
selected where one is free from distractions. Using a pendulum to locate an area
is also a help. One should be adept with pendulums as they can give "off"
readings to those who are less experienced.<P>
To use a pendulum, open a map of the area in which you wish to use and point
with a pencil, pen or whatever to specific locations on the map, asking the
pendulum whether or not the specific location would be supportive of your
workings. You can also ask the pendulum where the most powerful earth
energies are located. Take your pendulum to the spot and walk around. If intense
earth energies are present, your pendulum will begin to circle. Over really potent
spots, it will nearly circle so fast, it will go into a spin.<P>
Stone circles are ideal for enhancing earth energies and for a place to build your
psychic energies and powers. The color of the stones is important (see the
chapter on color). Using brown stones will amplify the earth energy to be directed
into your working. Brown stones will also amplify your psychic ability and attract
earth spirits.<P>
You should begin by marking your area and placing your stones around the
marked area. There should also be four points within your circle where you will
invoke the Four Crowned Princes of Hell (and invoke the four elements for
advanced mages). These four points should correspond to directions as you
would for a standard ritual. Lighted candles should be at the four points. You can
also invite Demon friends into the circle with you. You should be able to feel their
presence, or for those of us who are advanced, to see them in the circle with you.
After you have assembled your circle and are ready to begin, it is important to
breathe in form the earth and visualize a powerful electric blue light coming up
from your feet and into your hand, holding the athame. Point the athame, direct
the light to the tip, and mark your circle, visualizing the blue light and drawing a
counterclockwise circle with it.<P>
The energies raised need to be directed to your specific goal. When they peak,
gather them into a glowing ball or other form of your choosing, send the form on
its way with instructions, and visualize the energy penetrating your target.<P>
When you are finished, blow out the candles, north, then west, south then east.
Using your index finger pointing, erase all of the blue light of the circle, moving
clockwise in a smooth, slow sweep. Thank your Demon friends (if you had any
accompany you) and scatter the stones.<P>
You can also use the power of a stone circle to meditate in. This will act to
enhance your energy. Meditation can be done sitting or lying down. Use the blue
light for all of your workings.<P>
Satanism is one with nature.
