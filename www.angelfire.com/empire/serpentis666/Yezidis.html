There have been many conflicting articles concerning the Yezidi Devil worshippers of Iraq. The Yezidi people originally came from Southern Iraq and migrated north to Mount Lalish. It is believed they are descendants of the Assyrians who sought refuge after the fall of Nineveh in 612 BCE. &#185;
<P>

Eridu also known as "Enkidu" was an ancient city in Southern Iraq. 
This was Father Satan's [Enki"s] city. The Valley of Baten El Ghoul which is right over the buried ancient city is now known as "The Devil's Hole" and "Belly of the Beast." The Jordanians and many others consider it to be haunted. Demons have been seen by many who have spent the night there, mostly soldiers
in bivouac [camps]. Those who have been there for any length of time
claim it has a powerful energy which the followers of the Judeo/Christian/Muslim programs label as "evil."

<P>Those who have spent the night there also claim the entire area
is "bathed in a strange bluish grey light." "Apparitions" are also
seen. [The above information was taken from the book "Psychic
Warrior" by David Moorehouse]. The author was a US Army soldier who
was hit in the head by a mortar shell while camping with his platoon
in that valley and experienced psychic phenomena and abilities he
never had before the incident. He was eventually assigned to the US
Army Psychic Warfare Dept. 

<P> Iraq has many ancient artifacts and evidence of Satan. Mount Lalesh is near the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh and along a three hundred mile stretch are the Ziarahs; the Seven Towers of Satan with the center tower on Mount Lalesh. The "Seven Towers or Power houses -a high white cone shaped structure with bright rays flashing from its pinnnacle."&#178; 

<P>"...seven towers - the Towers of Satan [Ziarahs] -six of them trapezoidal in form, and one, the "center" on Mount Lalesh, shaped like a sharp, fluted point." 
<br>" The Satanic Rituals by Anton LaVey 
<p>
The above excerpt is also an allegory, as the center is the odd one out, the heart chakra. It does have power, but not the power of the strongest chakra of the soul, the '666' chakra of the Sun. The powers of the heart chakra are minimal. This is why the enemy is always touting it in the mainstream books, and in the new age dogma out there that is readily available to the public. 

<P>Each tower is topped by a brilliant heliographic reflector, and was intended to serve as a power house from where a Satanic/Yezidi Priest could beam his will to influence events in the world.

<P>The Yezidis have often been described as a secretive people who are not permitted to reveal their religion to outsiders; they keep their real beliefs hidden. Modern Yezidism has changed somewhat from the old ways due to outside interference. The Yezidi people have been severely persecuted and are very suspicious of outsiders. 
It is obvious their doctrines have been altered to conform to Christian beliefs as in the Qu"ret Al Yezid; Satan dictates he is a God and in other places it reads he is an "archangel." 

<P>Satan dictated the Al Jilwah directly to Yezidi prophet Sheik Adi in the 12th century. The Al Jilwah is the most important doctrine in Satanism and every Satanist should be familiar with its teachings. I asked Satan if the Al Jilwah was from him and he confirmed it was, but stated that the Muslims altered some of the Yezidi doctrines.

<P>The Yezidis have been victims of mass-murder and genocide at the hands of others, mainly those of the Christian and Muslim religions. In the year 1415 CE, Muslims desecrated and burned the tomb of Sheik Adi, ransacking his grave and removing his bones and burning them in front of the Yezidis. "Some of the Yezidi multitude they took as prisoners and made slaves of them, and the others they murdered." Badr al-Din further ordered the execution of two hundred members of the sect and had Sheik Adi"s bones disinterred and burned." &#179; 

<P>In 1892, Farik "Omar Pasa invited several Yezidi Chiefs to Mosul. His agenda was to collect 20 years of back taxes and to try to convert them to Islam. A few Christians were present at the meeting. He began to tell them that "if they would give up their Devil-worship, they would be rewarded with high place and rank, and would please the great Allah." When they refused to answer, Farik threw them into prison, marched on their village, and "slew about 500 of them." <sup>4</sup>

<P>Most Yezidis are illiterate and the few doctrines they have are passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. In order to avoid persecution, the Yezidi people have purposely deceived outsiders concerning their beliefs and doctrines. This explains why there are so many conflicting accounts of their faith. The Yezidis have very few scriptures; in the Al-Jilwah, Satan instructs: "I lead to the straight path without a book."
<BR>"Melek Ta"us taught "first by oral tradition and secondly by this book <I>Jilwe.</i>" <sup>5</sup>

<P>The Yezidi people are forbidden to say the name "Shaitan." They refer to Satan as "Melek Ta"us." Melek means "King." He is known as the Peacock Angel because of his beauty and pride. He is the "Proud One" and "Ruler of the Earth." He is a God of Light rather than of darkness and is concerned with the destinies of the world. <sup>4</sup>
  The Yezidis represent Satan by both the peacock and the snake. "The peacock represents the beauty of the worshipped God and the snake represents his wisdom because he is both beautiful and wise." Their holy relic is the copper sanjak, an image of the peacock. <sup>6</sup>

<P>The Yezidis play the flute and the tambourine at their festivals and dance; "a worship which led to every excess of debauchery and lust."<sup>7</sup>

<P>"The Jalwah and the Resh are the authentic holy scriptures of the Yezidis. The Yezidis not only acknowledge the loss of many copies of their scriptures but also Shaikh Hayder"s recording of the Book of Resh. The latter no doubt the Resh scripture was set down from memory." The Yezidis indeed avoid mentioning the very name "Satan" or any of his attributes, and have kept themselves aloof for centuries. Their books are a mystery. They also are forbidden to wear the color blue as this is the sacred color of Satan. <SUP>8</SUP>

<P>The Yezidis sometimes use the name "Ankar" for Satan and the name Angar-Manyu for Ahriman in Zoroastrianism. <sup>9</sup>

The Mishaf [Scripture] Resh [Black] the Yezidis believe was written by Shaikh Hasan al-Basri has been called "Black" because the word Satan is covered in it. It measures 28 x 21 cm. and has a leather cover. The Yezidis also have a reputation for being adepts at black magick. <sup>10</sup>
