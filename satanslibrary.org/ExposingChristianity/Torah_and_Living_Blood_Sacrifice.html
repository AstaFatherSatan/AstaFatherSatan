I am writing this article because I am so fed up with the endless stream of idiots who make YouTube videos and websites that expose Jewish ritual murder on the one hand and with the other, support Christianity, the Bible, the Nazarene and blame all of this on Satan. Some of these authors are actually Jewish and know what they are doing in regards to trying to blame it all on Satan and the Pagan [Gentile] Gods, while others [mostly Christians] have shit for brains. 
<P>
Most of these idiots who have shit for brains [nearly always a Christian] are either too lazy, not motivated or of course who lack the necessary intelligence to really read the Jewish Torah for what it is, the Old Testament. The entire Torah is chock full of the Jewish God’s instructions on how to properly perform living blood sacrifices, and for the Christian double-digit IQ idiots who try to make excuses in regards to the New Testament and “Jesus,” “Jesus” IS a human blood child sacrifice. 
<P>
In addition to this profound stupidity [the level of Christian intelligence is so low it is unbelievable], it never seems to occur to these bible-thumping morons that whine about Jewish ritual murder, and quote the Talmud, that the Talmud is in fact a rabbinical commentary on the Torah. And what is the Torah? The Torah is the first five books of the Old Testament of the Bible that these Christians with shit for brains promote. That’s right- THE OLD TESTAMENT. The same old crap that their priests and preachers spout off in their Christian churches every Sunday. Like I already stated the extent of the stupidity is beyond shocking. Also, these buzzard-brained Christians would be at a total loss to show exactly where in their Bible Satan ever even mentioned, let alone demanded, ANY sacrifices at all, let alone a living blood sacrifice! Yet they accuse him of this incessantly, as this creates a distraction. As I keep repeating, every ugly act and attribute that is of the Judeo/Christian “God” is blamed on Satan, yet few can see beyond this. Hardly anyone stops to think. 
<P>
Another thing I want to add here is how Christians and other related idiots twist everything. One glaring example is I came across was a statement regarding how the names of Pagan Gods such as Baal were used by Jews, such as Hasidim founder Ba’al Shem Tov. This title means “master of the good name” for one. This has to do with occult powers. It has nothing to do with the Pagan God Baal. 
<P>
“In Hebrew, the word ba'al means "husband" or "owner,” and is related to a verb meaning to take possession of, for a man, to consummate a marriage. The word "ba'al" is also used in many Hebrew phrases, denoting both concrete ownership as well as possession of different qualities in one's personality.” [1]
<P>
Baal also as I mentioned in the above means “master,” so this word really has a very broad term. Given the extreme blasphemy and denigration against the Pagan God Baal in the Goetia [The Lesser Key of Solomon], it is common sense that the Hebrews wouldn’t be giving any sort of devotion to this Pagan God, or any other Pagan Gods for that matter. Any references that try to claim the Hebrews worshipped any Pagan Gods are to confuse the readers. With our own research, we have found that Baal is another name for the Philistine God Beelzebub. The endless Jewish blasphemy against Beelzebub should make a statement in itself regarding just how hated this Pagan God is by the Jews. 
 
<P>The quote directly below is from “Bible Hub” website, article on Baal:
“4 with attributive: &#1489;&#1463;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500; &#1489;&#1456;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514; Lord of convenant Judges 8:33; Judges 9:4 (compare &#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; Judges 9:46; NöZMG 1888, 478); &#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1523;&#1489; Lord of flies 2 Kings 1:2,3,6,16, Philistine god, 5 &#914;&#945;&#945;&#955; &#956;&#965;&#8150;&#945;&#957; (Beelzebub, Matthew 12:24) compare Bael." [2]
 
<P>I would also like to comment on the extreme similarity between the name “Moloch” and the Hebrew word “Melek,” which means “King.” “King” is another real loose term. [3]
<P>
So… what does the Jewish Torah have to say regarding living blood sacrifice? For those of you who have any doubts, I strongly encourage you to do your own research, as there are numerous copies of the Jewish Torah here online. 
<P>
The story of the Jewish character Abraham about to sacrifice his son Isaac, as ordered by that alien god of theirs, is a blatant example that his mere willingness, without question, as the story goes, indicates this was nothing out of the norm, nor was this an unusual request. Given his unquestioning readiness, this reveals this act of human child sacrifice was commonplace. 
<P>
In addition to the above, here are some very interesting and very revealing quotes taken from the Jewish website <BR><A HREF="https://www.come-and-hear.com/editor/br_3.html">"Come and Hear, An Educational Forum For the Examination of Religious Truth and Religious Tolerance: Blood Ritual
3: Human Sacrifice, the Talmud, and the Moloch Problem" "LORD God Accepts Human Sacrifice"</a> 
<P>Quotes from the above linked website:
<BR>“Blood Ritual: — Blood ritual is fundamental to Judaism. Some blood sanctifies, some blood defiles. Let's see what the Talmud doctrines are.”
<P>
“The Babylonian Talmud, however, still permits Jews to sacrifice children to Moloch — under certain conditions.” 
<BR>“LORD God Accepts Human Sacrifice”
<BR>“First, let's get perspective. Some mistakenly believe human sacrifice is forbidden in the Old Testament. Certainly, some of the prophets railed against it. But in at least one book, LORD God accepts human sacrifice. And in another book, LORD God is appeased by human sacrifice.”
<P>
“In the following account from the Book of Judges, the Israelite warrior Jephthah is about to set off to make war on the Ammonites. In payment for victory, Jephthah promises LORD God he will sacrifice the first "whatsoever" that comes from his house to greet him upon his return. Unless Jephthah keeps oxen, sheep, goats, or chickens in his living room, he must expect the promised victim will be a human being. Notice that Jephthah does not promise to sacrifice "an ox" or "a goat," etc.”
<P>
30. And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,
<BR>31. Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.
<BR>— Judges 11:30-31 (KJV)
<P>
The first to pass through the doors of Jephthah's house upon his return is his only child, his beloved daughter. 
<P>
34. And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. 
<BR>35. And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back. 
<BR>— Judges 11:34-35 (KJV)
<P>
Let us reflect for a moment. We know Jephthah vowed to LORD God to sacrifice "whatsoever" first came out of the door of his house. We suspect Jephthah plans to sacrifice one of his servants. But when the "whatsoever" turned out to be Jephthah's daughter, Jephthah is surprised. Notice his daughter's reaction:
<P>
36. And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon. 
<BR>— Judges 11:36 (KJV)
<P>
“She expresses no surprise that LORD God would accept a human sacrifice, nor does she protest; she does not say, "Father, let's use some common sense.” 
<BR>None but perfect animals are permitted to be ritually sacrificed in Judaism. Notice that Jephthah's daughter, too, is a perfect sacrifice — she is a virgin. Notice that LORD God does not stop this human sacrifice, as he stopped the sacrifice of Abraham's son. 
<P>
The Old Testament does not specify how Jephthah sacrifices his daughter, but following the correct methods for animal sacrifice, he would slit her throat first and drain her blood into a Temple service vessel; cut off her arms, legs, and head; cut the torso in sections, remove her entrails and wash them; pour, sprinkle, and smear her blood at prescribed points around the altar; and burn the flesh. Or of course, a priest might do this for him.” [4]
<P>
“LORD God is Appeased by Human Sacrifice” [5]
<P>
“As two separate offences, proving that giving one's seed to Molech is not idolatry. The differences [sic] is, that if one sacrificed to Molech, or caused his son to pass through the fire to some other deity, he is not punished.”
<BR>—Rabbi Dr. Freedman
<P>
“Following the Mishnah, Sanhedrin 64a and 64b contain a rousing debate between the Sages concerning: 
<P>
• the circumstances under which worshipping an idol is idolatry, 
<BR>• which idols may be worshipped without indulging in idolatry, 
<BR>• which parts of child sacrifice in what combination are punishable, and 
<BR>• how children may be sacrificed without violating Leviticus.
 
<P>“Of late, numerous attempts have been made to prove that in sacrificing their children to Moloch the Israelites simply thought that they were offering them in holocaust to Yahweh. In other words, the Melech to whom child-sacrifices were offered was Yahweh under another name. “[6]
<P>
The article goes on and tries to claim otherwise, but any fool can readily see when reading the biblical book of Leviticus for example, that the above statement speaks for itself.
<P>
Here is more from the “Come and Hear” Jewish website:
<BR>“It is indeed unfortunate that the Jewish religion has not repudiated the doctrine that children may be sacrificed to Moloch. That doctrine, along with prayers in the Jewish liturgy calling for the return of ritual blood sacrifice (see Animal Sacrifice and the Third Temple), surely adds credence to charges that Jews engage in the ritual blood sacrifice of children.”
<BR>“Repudiating the Talmud doctrines that approve of ritually sacrificing children (under certain conditions) would go a long way to creating good will between Judaism and people of other religious faiths.” [7]
<P>
The Book of Leviticus is chock full of specific instructions [how to] and demands for living blood sacrifices. 
 
<P>Below are direct quotes taken from the Jewish Torah. Given the extensive and horrendous treatment of innocent animals, it is no wonder that the Jews invented industrial farming. This sort of thing is in their nature. 
<P>
<BR>(LEV 1:1) The LORD called to Moshe, and spoke to him out of the Tent of Meeting, saying, 
<BR>(LEV 1:2) "Speak to the children of Yisra'el, and tell them,

<BR>(LEV 22:26) The LORD spoke to Moshe, saying,
