<P><I>"Christianity and communism are very close spiritually and ideologically. This is a fairly well known concept that has been adopted by various thinkers, from Thomas More to Lev Tolstoy. Few people know that the world's first socialist state was established in Paraguay and was based on the ideas of Catholic Jesuits before Marx created his teachings." 
 
 <P>
 
"The "Society of Jesus" - the Jesuit religious order - in the Catholic Church was roughly equivalent to the KGB in the Soviet Union."</I>

<P>Communism is not anti-Christian, as is commonly believed: 
 
<BR>In addition to this, the Catholic Church in China has over 70 million members and is growing. There is also the Catholic Changchung Cathedral in Communist North Korea; the nominal cathedral of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Pyongyang, North Korea. The Russian Orthodox Church worked hand in hand with the Communist Party in the USSR. The violence against its Clergy during the revolution, was simply to weed out the Czarist elements from its ranks, and nothing more.  Stalin openly worked with the Orthodox Church to help the Communist war effort for the Red Army during the second world war.  Today in Russia, high ranking Clergy in the Russian Orthodox Church openly advocate a Christian Communist movement within their nation. The Catholic Church also has had a strong hand in the Communistic, Liberation Theology in South America. It’s no mistake Catholic Clergy could traverse the “Iron Curtain” during the cold war with ease.

<P><I>"Ernst Bloch (1885–1977) was a German Marxist philosopher and atheist theologian. Although not a Christian himself, he is said to have "bridged the gap" between Christian communism and the Leninist branch of Marxism. One of Bloch's major works, the Principle of Hope, contains such declarations as: "Ubi Lenin, ibi Jerusalem" [Where Lenin is, there is Jerusalem] and "the Bolshevist fulfillment of Communism [is part of] the age-old fight for God." </I><SUP>2</SUP> 
 
<P>In truth, Christianity prepares the populace to be open to and to accept communism. There is nothing within the Christian doctrines or the teachings of the Nazarene that conflicts with communism in any way. Christianity IS Communism. 
 <P><UL>
<LI>Both programs work to enslave, using terror, brutality, mass murder and coersion. The Catholic Church was the KGB of the Middle Ages, ruling through terror, use of force and mass murder. The <A HREF="The_Inquisition.html">Inquisition</a> is a blatant example.
 
<BR><BR><LI>Both programs prohibit the ownership of private property. Christianity prepares followers on a subliminal level for communism. Christians are indoctrinated to believe that poverty is a virtue. Once this concept takes hold upon one's  subconscious mind, quite often, a serious lack of money is a result and this sometimes even lasts into future lives, speaking from a spiritual perspective. What this does is it also creates a self-perpetuating program, and in turn creates generations of poor. The Christian Churches then appear as helpers of the poor and benefactors, when all along, it was the Christian teachings that created and enforced the problem. The Jew creates the problems and then gives the Jewish version of a damned solution for Gentiles. <A HREF="../666BlackSun/Mind_Control_Programming.html">Click here for an article econcerning Christian Mind Control</a>
 
 <BR><BR>
<LI>There is nothing at all spiritual about Christianity. Christianity is a tool for removing spiritual knowledge and powers, and replacing these with meaningless robotic 'prayers' corrupted from and repeated in the same fashion as Far Eastern mantras, and endless indoctrination with false teachings aimed to imbed a fictitious status and history of the Jewish people in the minds of Christians, which is nothing spiritual at all. Few if any Christian preachers can diagram the human soul, for example. The removal of and the corruption of spiritual knowledge prepares the populace to accept the atheistic communist state. 
 <BR><BR>
<LI>Both Christianity and Communism present themselves as brotherhood programs, promoting equality, prosperity, good will, and a better way of life, but upon closer examination of their real doctrines and histories, this is nothing more than a come-along and beneath the surface, terror, mass murder, torture, forced indoctrination, and keeping the populace ignorant are the bulwark of both of these programs. Any fool who reads the Judeo/Christian Bible can plainly see the endless accounts of mass murder, pillaging, rape, enslavement, and threats of eternal torture and damnation if the doctrines are not taken seriously or adhered to, and above all, how jewhova was a murderous monster who preyed upon Gentiles; no different from the communist programs. For proof of this see <A HREF="YHVH_Murderer.html">"Jehova and Human Blood Sacrifice."</a> "A Murderer and a Liar from the Beginning."
 
<br><BR><I>"But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me." </I>
 <BR>Luke 19: 27 
<BR>[Direct quote from Jesus advocating murder]
  <BR><BR>
<LI>"Rebellion" is a definite NO NO and is "of the Devil." 
 </UL>
 
 
 
<P>Christianity also prepares followers for communism in that one is indoctrinated to endure injustice. Nearly everyone has heard the biblical scriptures about turning the other cheek, walking the extra mile, loving one's enemies and so forth. These teachings work together with communism in destroying the justice system and personal rights. Crime is allowed to get so out of control [as it already has]; that the populace is not only discouraged from fighting back, but if one should defend one's self, one is often punished for this. What these Jewish programs do, is they set a trap. Most people eventually are more than willing to give up their rights in favor of ultra-strict laws in order to control crime. Both programs prohibit taking any personal action in the way of enforcing justice and place this responsibility in the hands of the state for communism, and in the hands of that so-called "God" for Christianity. Any rebellion or fighting back is a grave offense. The acceptance of abuse and injustice are both very necessary for establishing a slave state. A slave must never try to fight back or rebel in any way. Hate is another taboo in both programs. 
 <P>
A look into Communism’s birth:
 <BR>
Communism  was created out  of the organization “The League of the Just.”
The motto of the League of the Just ("Bund der Gerechten" or "Bund der Gerechtigkeit") was "All Men are Brothers" and its goals were "the establishment of the Kingdom of God on Earth, based on the ideals of love of one's neighbor, equality and justice".
<BR><I>“At a congress held in London in June 1847 the League of the Just merged with members of the Communist Corresponding Committee headed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, adopting a new organizational charter and programme and reconstituting itself as the Communist League.”</I> <SUP>[3]</SUP>
 <BR>
This is the basis of the Christian doctrine.
 <P>
We can trace Communism’s  roots back to the radical Liberal ideology in Europe. Which itself is Christianity in disguise.
As Nietzsche stated about the French revolution and its Liberal ideology as the: <I>“Daughter and continuation of Christianity.”</I>
 
<P>This radical, universalist, egalitarian doctrine is at the heart of Christianity, and Liberalism with its stepping off point into Communism.
Where Liberalism then morphed into Communism openly:
 <P>
<I>“During the decade of the 1840s the word "communist" came into general use to describe those who hailed the left wing of the Jacobin Club of the French Revolution as their ideological forefathers. This political tendency saw itself as egalitarian heritors of the 1795 Conspiracy of Equals headed by Gracchus Babeuf. The sans-culottes of Paris which had decades earlier been the base of support for Babeuf — artisans, journeymen, and the urban unemployed — was seen as a potential foundation for a new social system based upon the modern machine production of the day.”</I>
 
<P>The French thinker Étienne Cabet inspired the imagination with a novel about a utopian society based upon communal machine production- "Voyage en Icarie" [1839]. The revolutionary Louis Auguste Blanqui argued in favor of an elite organising the overwhelming majority of the population against the "rich," seizing the government in a coup d'état, and instituting a new egalitarian economic order.” <SUP>4</SUP>

Revilo Oliver:
<BR>Quote:
<BR><I>"The other apostates I have mentioned, and many that are now forgotten, together
with almost all of the anti-Christians of recent centuries, exemplify the
operation of what may be called the law of cultural residues. In all civilized
societies, when a long-established and generally accepted belief is found to be
incredible, good minds abandon it, but they commonly retain derivative beliefs
that were originally deduced from the creed they have rejected and logically
must depend on it. Thus it happened that modern enemies of Christianity rejected
the mythology, but uncritically retained faith in the social and ethical
superstitions derived from it — a faith which they oddly call rational but hold
with a religious fervor."
 <P>
"They laugh at the silly story about Adam and his spare rib, but they continue to
believe in a "human race" descended from a single pair of ancestors and hence in
a "brotherhood of man." They speak of "all mankind," giving to the term an
unctuous and mystic meaning with which they do not invest corresponding terms,
such as "all marsupials" or "all ungulates." They prate about the "rights of
man," although a moment's thought should suffice to show that, in the absence of
a decree from a supernatural monarch, there can be no rights other than those
which the citizens of a stable and homogeneous society have, by covenant or
established custom, bestowed on themselves; and that while the citizens may show
kindness to aliens, slaves, and dogs, such beings obviously can have no rights."
 <P>
"They do not believe that one-third of a god became incarnate in the most squalid
region on earth to associate with illiterate peasants, harangue the rabble of a
barbarian race, and magically exalt the ignorant and uncouth to "make folly of
the wisdom of this world," so that "the last shall be first" — that they do not
believe, but they cling to the morbid hatred of superiority that makes
Christians dote on whatever is lowly, inferior, irrational, debased, deformed,
and degenerate."
 <P>
"They gabble about the 'sanctity of human life' — especially the vilest forms of
it — without reflecting that it takes a god creator to make something sacred.
And they frantically agitate for a universal "equality" that can be attained
only by reducing all human beings to the level of the lowest, evidently unaware
that they are merely echoing the Christians' oft-expressed yearning to become
sheep (the most stupid of all mammals) herded by a good shepherd, which is
implicit in all the tales of the New Testament, although most bluntly expressed
in another gospel, which reports Jesus as promising that after he has tortured
and butchered the more civilized populations of the earth, there will be a
Resurrection, and his ovine pets will pop out of their graves, all of the same
age, all of the same sex, all of the same stature, and all having
indistinguishable features, so that they will be as identical as the bees in a
swarm."
 <P>
"Although the "Liberal" and Marxist cults have doctrinal differences as great as
those that separate Lutherans from Baptists, they are basically the same
superstition, and whether or not we should call them religions depends on
whether we restrict the word to belief in supernatural persons or extend it to
include all forms of blind faith based on emotional excitement instead of
observed facts and reason. When those "atheistic" cults scream out their hatred
of "Fascists" and "Nazis," they obviously must believe that those wicked persons
are possessed of the Devil and should therefore be converted or exterminated to
promote holiness and love. And when they see "racists," who impiously substitute
fact and reason for unthinking faith in approved fairy stories, their lust to
extirpate evil is as great as that of the Christian mob that dragged the fair
and too intelligent Hypatia from her carriage and lovingly used oyster shells to
scrape the flesh from her bones while she was still alive."
 <P>
"With very few exceptions, the anti-Christians, no doubt unwittingly, retained in
their minds a large part of Christian doctrine, and they even revived the most
poisonous elements of the primitive Bolshevism of Antiquity, which had been
attenuated or held in abeyance by the established churches in the great days of
Christendom. And today, professed atheists do not think it odd that, on all
social questions, they are in substantial agreement with the howling dervishes
and evangelical shamans who, subsidized with lavish publicity by the Organized
Jewry who control the boob-tubes and other means of communication, greedily
participate in the current drive to reduce Americans to total imbecility with
every kind of irrational hoax."</I>
 <P><I>
“Christian theology is the grandmother of Bolshevism.” </I> <BR>-- Oswald Spengler
 
 <P>We can witness this statement with the open banner of Christian Communism:
 
<BR>"Christian communists seek to achieve large-scale social change, however. Some believe that, rather than attempting to transform the politics and economics of an entire country, Christians should instead establish communism at a local or regional level only."
 <P>
The Latin American branch of Christian Communist Liberation Theology, according to theologians such as Leonardo Boff; is rooted in the concept that "prudence is the understanding of situations of radical crisis". Among Christian Communists, Historical Materialism is utilised as a methodology of analysis to define the nature of the crisis in question as a product of political-economic dynamics and modalities derived from the workings of what is termed "the late capitalist/imperialist mode of production". According to this subset of Liberation Theology, the challenge for the Christian Communist is then to define what it means (in context of "a concrete analysis of the concrete social reality"), to affirm a "preferential option for the poor and oppressed" as Praxis (active theory),and as commanded by an ethics allegedly "rooted in the beatidic teachings of Jesus". 
 
<P>Christian Communist Liberation Theology is not about evangelization per se, but rather about developing an Orthopraxis (ethical action; The condition of coming to the light by doing the works of God), that aims to reconcile the "Beatidic Ethics" of Jesus, as expoused in the Sermon on the Mount; with existing social struggles against what is termed "neo-colonialism" or "Late Capitalism". Both Christian Communism and Liberation Theology stress "orthopraxis" over "orthodoxy". A narrative of the nature of contemporary social struggles is developed via "materialist analysis" utilising historiographic concepts developed by Karl Marx. A concrete example are the Paraguayan Sin Tierra (landless) movement, who engage in direct land seizures and the establishment of socialized agricultural cooperative production in asentamientos. The contemporary Paraguayan Sin Tierra operate in a very similar manner as that of the reformation era Diggers. For Camilo Torres (the founder of the Colombian guerrilla group E.L.N.), developing this Orthopraxis meant celebrating the Catholic Eucharist only among those engaged in armed struggle against the army of the Colombian state, while fighting alongside them.
 
 <P>
 
Christian communists hold the Biblical verses in Acts 2 and 4 as evidence that the first Christians lived in a communist society. Thomas Wharton Collens' Preaching is a good description of biblical sources being used with the goal of a common-property society; Prof. José P. Miranda, "Comunismo en la Biblia" (1981), translated as, "Communism in the Bible" (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis Books, 1982).
 <P>
But, in addition, they also cite numerous other Biblical passages which, in their view, support the idea that communism is the most ethical social system and that it is inescapably constitutive of the kingdom of God on earth. The most often quoted of these Biblical citations are taken from the three synoptic Gospels, which describe the life and ministry of Jesus.
 <P>
One of Jesus' most famous remarks regarding the wealthy can be found in Matthew 19:16–24 (the same event is also described in Mark 10:17–25 and Luke 18:18–25, and the metaphor of a camel going through the eye of a needle is common to both Matthew and Luke).
 
 <P>
21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. 23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
 
<P>
Jesus also described "money changers" (i.e. those engaged in currency exchange) as "thieves" and chased them out of the Temple in Jerusalem. This is described in Matthew 21:12–14, Mark 11:15, and John 2:14–16. 
 
 
 <P>
In addition, communistic attitudes and implications can be found in Leviticus 25:35–38: Most significantly, this is part of the Law of Moses, and as such is commandment rather than exhortation or airing of opinion. This fact bears heavily upon subsequent discussion of the question of compulsory or voluntary relinquishing of riches, either as a possible entry requirement to Christian grace or as a means of achieving divine intentions for human social order. <SUP>5</SUP>
