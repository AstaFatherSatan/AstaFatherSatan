There are a small number of deluded 
Gentile fools who try to claim the Nazarene was a Gentile. The following 
biblical scriptures prove beyond any doubt the Jewishness of the Nazarene, and 
his relation to the Gentiles. As for the Jewishness of his teachings, see <A 
href="Xianity_and_Communism.html">"Christianity and 
Communism: Jewish Twins."</A> 
<P>The Nazarene is a fictitious JEWISH INVENTED ARCHETYPE for Gentiles to 
slavishly worship. This character is based upon some 18+ crucified Pagan Gods 
STOLEN and CORRUPTED from GENTILE pantheons! For more information proving the 
nazarene character is fictitious, click on the links provided at the bottom of 
this webpage. The Jews themselves know the nazarene is a lie! 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Matthew 1: 1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, 
  the son of Abraham.</LI></UL>
<P>Who was Abraham? 
<UL>
  <LI>Genesis 14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the 
  Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and 
  brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Genesis 17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you 
  and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. 
</LI></UL>
<P>Circumcision was not a popular practice among the Gentiles: <BR>Male 
Circumcision in the Renaissance: <BR><I>Europeans, with the exception of the 
Jews, did not practice male circumcision.¹ <BR>In 1753 in London, there was a 
proposal for Jewish emancipation. It was furiously opposed by the pamphleteers 
of the time, who spread the fear that Jewish emancipation meant universal 
circumcision. <BR>Men were urged to protect: <BR>"The best of your property" and 
guard their threatened foreskins. ...a striking indication of how central to 
their sexual identity men considered their foreskins at that time. ² <BR>Until 
well into the Nineteenth Century, the same sentiments prevailed. Richard Burton 
observed that "Christendom practically holds circumcision in horror". This 
attitude is reflected in the ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica 
(1876) which discusses the practice as a religious rite among Jews, Moslems, the 
ancient Egyptians and tribal peoples in various parts of the world. The author 
of the entry rejected sanitary explanations of the procedure in favour of a 
religious one: "like other body mutilations ... [it is] of the nature of a 
representative sacrifice". ³</I> 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Matthew 1: 2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat 
  Judas and his brethren; 
  <LI>Hebrews 7: 14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which 
  tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Matthew 2: 1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of 
  Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, 
  <LI>2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his 
  star in the east, and are come to worship him. </LI></UL>
<P>According to rabbinical law and in the tradition of male Jews, the Nazarene 
was circumcised and named on the eighth day in the temple (Jewish term for 
synagogue) by a rabbi: 
<UL>
  <LI>Luke 2: 21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of 
  the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before 
  he was conceived in the womb. </LI></UL>
<P>Jesus' mother Mary was also very observant of orthodox Jewish law where a 
woman is unclean following her menstrual period, or childbirth: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Leviticus 12: 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
  <LI>2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived 
  seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to 
  the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean. 
  <LI>3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 
  <LI>4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and 
  thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, 
  until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. </LI></UL>
<P>Modern orthodox Jews still follow these laws. <BR>The following scriptures 
are rather blatant regarding the Jewish identity of the Nazarene and his 
relation to non-Jews (Gentiles): 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Luke 2: 25 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was 
  Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of 
  Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. 
  <LI>26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see 
  death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. 
  <LI>27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought 
  in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, 
  <LI>28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 
  <LI>29 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy 
  word: 
  <LI>30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, 
  <LI>31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; 
  <LI>32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. 
  </LI></UL>
<P>Note in the above verse 32, the distinction between Gentiles and "Israel." 
<P>Both of the Nazarene's parents were observant Jews who made the yearly 
pilgrimage for the Feast of the Passover: <UL<LI>Luke 2: 41 Now his parents went 
to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.
<UL></UL>
<P>The Nazarene was very clear in his attitudes towards the Gentiles and the 
distinction between Jew and Gentile: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Matthew 20: 25 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the 
  princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great 
  exercise authority upon them. 
  <LI>But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, 
  let him be your minister;</LI></UL>
<P>He was called "Rabbi" and by his own people (Jews): 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>John 20:16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto 
  him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. <BR><BR>
  <LI>John 3: 1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of 
  the Jews: 
  <LI>2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that 
  thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou 
  doest, except God be with him. <BR><BR>
  <LI>John 6: 24 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither 
  his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for 
  Jesus. 
  <LI>25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said 
  unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? <BR><BR>
  <LI>John 1: 37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 
 
  <LI>38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What 
  seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, 
  Master,) where dwellest thou?</LI></UL>
<P>And a "Jew" by the Gentiles: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>John 4: 9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, 
  being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews 
  have no dealings with the Samaritans. He upheld Jewish Law: <BR><BR>
  <LI>Matthew 5: 17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the 
  prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 
  <LI>18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one 
  tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. </LI></UL>
<P>He regularly attended and taught in the Jewish synagogue and observed the 
Jewish Sabbath. The Jews loved and glorified him: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Luke 4: 14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and 
  there went out a fame of him through all the region round about. 
  <LI>15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. 
  <LI>16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his 
  custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to 
  read. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Luke 21: 37 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at 
  night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives. 
  <LI>38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for 
  to hear him. </LI></UL>
<P>Only Jews were allowed in the temple. Gentiles were and are to this day 
considered "unclean" by both conservative and orthodox Jews: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Acts 21: 25 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and 
  concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves 
  from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from 
  fornication. 
  <LI>26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them 
  entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of 
  purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them. 
  <LI>27 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, 
  when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on 
  him, 
  <LI>28 Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men 
  every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further 
  brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place 
</LI></UL>
<P>Note the above scriptures do not pertain to the Nazarene, but to “Paul.” The 
Nazarene was long gone at this time according to scripture. Though Paul was a 
Jew, his mission was to the Gentiles. 
<P>Like his parents, he observed the Passover: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>John 2: 13 And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to 
  Jerusalem. <BR><BR>
  <LI>John 7: 2 Now the Jew’s feast of tabernacles was at hand. 
  <LI>10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the 
  feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
  <LI>11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? <BR><BR>
  <LI>John 7: 14 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, 
  and taught. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Luke 22: 14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve 
  apostles with him. 
  <LI>15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover 
  with you before I suffer: </LI></UL>
<P>He also observed Hanukkah: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>John 10: 22 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it 
  was winter. 
  <LI>23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch. </LI></UL>
<P>He quoted the Hebrew scriptures: 
<UL>
  <LI>Matthew 4: 1 Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be 
  tempted of the devil. 
  <LI>2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an 
  hungred. 
  <LI>3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, 
  command that these stones be made bread. 
  <LI>4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread 
  alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. 
  <LI>5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a 
  pinnacle of the temple, 
  <LI>6 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it 
  is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their 
  hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a 
  stone. 
  <LI>7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord 
  thy God. 
  <LI>8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and 
  sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 
  <LI>9 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall 
  down and worship me. 
  <LI>10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, 
  Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 
  <LI>11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered 
  unto him. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Deuteronomy 8: 3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed 
  thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he 
  might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word 
  that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Deuteronomy 6: 16 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him 
  in Massah. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Deuteronomy 6: 13 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and 
  shalt swear by his name.</LI></UL>
<P>Note in the above scenario, though fictitious, Satan approached the Nazarene 
not as an equal, but as superior. An equal does not worship an equal. 
<P>He readily admitted to his Jewish identity: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Mark 15: 2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he 
  answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.</LI></UL>
<P>Many deluded Gentiles claim the Nazarene was murdered by the Jews, thus he 
must be a Gentile. This is utter nonsense as the scriptures prove otherwise. The 
Jews only punish their own for breaking Jewish law, as only one born of a Jewish 
mother can be a Jew and held accountable to Jewish law: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Matthew 26: 64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say 
  unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of 
  power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 
  <LI>65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken 
  blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard 
  his blasphemy. 
  <LI>66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. <BR><BR>
  <LI>John 19: 7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought 
  to die, because he made himself the Son of God. 
  <LI>John 18: 31 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him 
  according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for 
  us to put any man to death: 
  <LI>John 18: 35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief 
  priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? </LI></UL>
<P>He was buried as a Jew: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>John 19: 40 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen 
  clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</LI></UL>

<P>The problem is most people believe what they are told. In order to expose 
Christianity, one must delve deeply into "forbidden knowledge." When one begins 
intense research into the "occult" occasionally one will meet with frightening 
experiences. This is because of the mind/spiritual power that has been put into 
protecting this knowledge for centuries, and keeping it forbidden. Orthodox Jews 
at the higher levels, and their Gentile lackeys, such as the ultra-corrupt 
Vatican of the Catholic Church (which is and always has been their tool to 
control the Gentiles), have known about and used this power for centuries. One 
must continue on relentlessly and there comes a point where the real truth will 
be accessed and the powers the enemy has used are no longer effective.<BR>*Just 
to clarify, this has not been my own experience. I have studied freely under the 
direct protection of Satan.
