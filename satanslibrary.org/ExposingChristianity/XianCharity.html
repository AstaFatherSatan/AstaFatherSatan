<META NAME="DESCRIPTION" CONTENT="Christian charity funds terrorism, organized crime and other destructive operations. Contrary to what most people believe, Sunday and other donations are not used to "feed and clothe the needy."

<LI>"Because the churches are tax-exempt, the average citizen pays an additional $925.00 a year in taxes to support them."
<br><br><li>"According to the Internal Revenue Service, church donations total over 19 <I><B>BILLION</B></I> dollars a year. "This <u>does not</u> include profits from businesses, stock holdings, bond holdings, retirement centers or lease back arrangements."
<br><br><li>"The Mormon Church alone collects at least $4.3 billion a year from its members and another $400 million from its many business enterprises purchased with tax-exempt donated money. "
<br><br><li>"The churches own 81 billion dollars' worth of tax-exempt real estate in Texas and $1.3 billion in Los Angeles county alone. Consider the prime real estate owned by them in New York City, Chicago, Boston, in every state - the amount involved is staggering."
<br><br><li>"Every tax dollar that the church avoids paying, you as an individual tax payer must make up."
<br><br><li>Growing in power and ownership, the Christian churches own 20-25% of all the real estate in America.

<P>The House Chaplain's salary 1993 was $115,300.00
<BR>The Senate Chaplain's salary was about the same with an additional $300,000.00 budget including pay for secretaries and office space. <SUP>1</SUP>


<P>On the subject of abortion, 
this 
 is definitely a personal issue, but I want to expose what is
being 
 done behind the scenes of the Christian "pro-life" movements. 
 <P>
 First off, I want to mention if Christianity had not held us back, 
there 
 would be effective birth control. Forced abstinence is not
healthy 
 and it does not work. 
 <P>
 As for the Christian Church and the Catholic stance on banning
birth 
 control and abortion, this is another huge money making
racket. 
The 
 children are the ones who pay. The intentions behind this made 
 available to the public as propaganda, come with the pretext of 
good 
 will and humanitarianism. Behind the scenes, there is the true 
story.
 <P>
 American Atheists did an exposé on "Mother Theresa" some
years 
 back. This woman has received millions if not more in
donations. 
 Most of the money is unaccounted for. 
 <P>
 The largest number of victims of the pro-life movement are
from 
 third world countries. Most of these countries in Africa,
Central 
 and South America and Asia have been exploited and infested
with 
 Christianity. Missionaries are forever returning to these areas of
the 
 world as prime hosts for their vicious agenda as these people
are 
 poor and illiterate. 
 <P>
 To feed, clothe and house an individual in most of these
places, 
it 
 costs only 10 cents a day and a bowl of rice. Children are
walking 
 around emaciated, in rags and filthy. The mortality rate is
high 
and 
 the churches use this to rake in millions upon millions in tax 
 exempt donations to "give" to these children. The sad fact is 
little 
 or nothing ever reaches the children. Because the infant
mortality 
 rate is so high due to starvation and disease, the Catholic 
Church 
 exploits this with a ban on birth control and abortion. This in turn provides the church with more 
poster 
 children to use to rake in more money, keeping the 
unfortunate 
 babies coming. In addition, many of these children are viciously and brutally used for slave labor. The Jewish owned and operated corporate monopolies want cheap slave labor in the way of disposable human beings who can be systematically worked to death; no different from Jewish communism.
 <P>
 With the Western currency markup in each of these countries,
the 
 churches could easily afford to have the entire third world
living 
 decently. This is nothing more than a tragic money making
racket. 
In 
 the rare event these Christian leaders are ever investigated, the dirt
found 
on 
 them is endless. The Christian Church with all of its tax-exempt wealth and funding has organized into a powerful voting bloc.
<P><blockquote><P> "They have tied up so many senators and representatives, having their own religious lobbying groups, that it has been next to impossible to enforce any kind of tax laws or tax violations against them, allowing them to continue to gain in power with unlimited funds." <SUP>2</SUP></blockquote>
 <P>
 In Mexico, poor barefoot ragged people walk down a burning
dusty 
 road for 15 miles to attend a lavish church that takes a 
percentage 
 of their income while they live in slum like conditions with 
 dwellings of dirt floors and a corrugated tin for a roof. The 
 churches are lined with gold and continue to tithe from these 
 people. 
 <P>
 Christian charity is a sham. They give as little as possible up
front 
 before the public to keep a humanitarian image, but most of
the 
 donations line the pockets of their preachers and are funneled into organized criminal activities, and for the advancement of Jewish communism. The problems
people 
 come to them with are rarely if ever alleviated. Drug addicts
are 
 told to pray and so forth. They are kept from power meditation, and knowledge of the soul, which 
 would heal their cravings. People remain cripples in the Christian 
 system and are used for exploitation. Newbies who come to
"Jesus" 
 are taken in again and again, but "Jesus" doesn't last long
and 
the 
 person "backslides" into worse conditions than before as in
addition 
 to their problems and misfortunate circumstances that brought
them 
 in, "Jesus" shits on them.


<P>Most of the Christian donations go to fund war and organized criminal activities</h1>

<P>The "National and World Council of Churches" includes the membership of the Lutheran, Episcopal, Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist and other denominations. 

<P><blockquote><P>"The World Council of Churches and its affiliate, The National Council of Churches supported by church donated dollars quietly help to finance selected covert operations and wars." "Mainline churches support left-wing causes and killings, and fundamentalist churches support right-wing causes and killings. The blood is on the hands of every donor." <P>"<I>In chilling testimony given at American University in Washington D.C., and televised over C-Span on Dec. 12, 1989, ex-CIA officer John Stockwell told how the Christian Contras burst into the huts of innocent villagers. He saw them drag a man out of one house and castrate him in front of his wife and children. These savages next raped his wife, then cut off her breasts with their bayonets. [Their] terrified children were forced to watch. Again, these atrocities were partially financed by the dollars put in the collection plates of the neighborhood churches that tell the faithful that these special collections go to the 'world hunger fund.' Compounding the tragedy, the Nicaraguans are wonderful people, love Americans and still cannot understand why America would do this to them." <SUP>3</SUP>

</blockquote></i>

<P>"Jesus" Doesn't Heal Drug Addicts</h1>
 
<P>It is nothing but a huge money making racket and the
exploitation of 
human beings. Something must be replaced with something; not 
nothing. The Christian victim usually "backslides." People with
serious 
drug habits need to mend the weak areas and holes in their auras
and 
empower themselves with the energy they need so they will not
slide 
into addiction again. The Christian churches provide none of this.
They 
only lure people who are desperate in to exploit them for their 
money. The victim pays large sums of money and is given new
problems 
he/she did not have before in exchange. The Nazarene and ilk sap
the 
victim's self-esteem, confidence and vital energies, setting
him/her 
up for a relapse into addiction. The relapse is received with
the 
victim being told he/she is a "sinner" and needs to repent
[further 
lowering self-esteem, personal worth, and confidence in one's
abilities, 
that is so drastically needed to overcome the addiction]. This
sets 
up a vicious cycle of human exploitation and cruelty. 
<P>
Satan gives us the strength, self-esteem and power to beat drug 
addiction. When one's chakras and aura are healthy, one does not 
crave these kinds of substances to make up for psychic
deficiencies. 


<P>In closing, the social services with the welfare department and other state/government run agencies; the Red Cross and so forth, all do hundreds of times over, more to aid the underprivileged and poverty stricken than does the Christian churches. In addition, unlike the Christian churches and missions, they don't demand your freedom, your mind and your soul.
