Angelic entities seem to follow the same pattern in
dealing with people. Known by different names;
"Watchers" "Guardians" "Gatekeepers" their true nature
is to keep humanity from progressing in any way
especially in the area of spiritual power or knowledge. 
They are like guards in a concentration camp; the "Watchtowers." Angels are human-hating extraterrestrials and their agenda is to keep
humanity spiritually enslaved and without power. 
<P>
Those who are without and delve into the occult a
little too deeply will often meet with unpleasant
experiences [again, FEAR is often used as a means of
control]. One way or another, those who are without
are often deceived into relationships with angels. 
<P>
Of course there are variations, but here is what to
look for- you will see this if you read anything about
people's experiences:
<P>
<UL><LI> The angelic entity intrudes. Most often the
creature is uninvited and takes it upon itself to
barge in on someone's psyche totally uninvited.
<P>
<LI> The entity uses love to lower the victim's
defenses. This is done deliberately and masks the
entity's true intentions. The victim [human beings are
emotionally vulnerable- how many serious mistakes have
been made at the mercy of our emotions] feels the
"love" and is deceived into believing this is a
positive visitor.
<P>
<LI> The entity never explains much or gives the victim
any valuable knowledge. Most questions are not
answered, if they are, they are in riddles or
nonsense. Any information given is either incorrect or
incomplete.
<P>
<LI> Often, the entity will make a statement that it is
coming to warn the victim and/or humanity of "erring
ways." This many times has to do with anything the entity deems as 
a threat to their total control, in most cases playing upon the ability for one to
defend one's self; humanity's use of mind power for psychic self defense is extremely threatening to these alien predators as their main tool of control is through the mind; their worst worry is should humanity ever discover the truth and attain the same powers of the mind as they possess. They preach a false concept of
"peace" and "love" to disarm humanity and create a
helpless/defenseless earth. Their own convictions
concerning this are made blatantly clear throughout
the Christian Bible where they are bringers of torture,
suffering, and death. The book of revelation/apocalypse
says it all.
<P>
<li>The entity in many cases delivers negative
prophesy. Most often, this predicts personal ruin,
disaster for the victim, his/her loved ones or others
who are close. The entity then offers false
reassurance that it will remain with the victim
through all of this, but does not lift a finger to
stop it. <P>
<LI> The entity in many cases, such as with ignorant
[unknowing] new age people, acts as a healer when
channeled. As usual, no knowledge of any value is
given and the healer as well as the patient remain
cripples and are helpless without the entity's
assistance, making them slaves. 
</UL>


<P>I have dealt with these entities and they are anything but 
benevolent. They are bringers of death, misfortune and their victims of choice are
children. I have seen this many times. People who get into angel 
magick are either extremely arrogant or their personal lives end up 
in disaster. One guy who was into this sort of thing was severely depressed and into drugs. 
<P>
When I was a small child, my mother told me her parents had a baby 
girl several years before she was born. This little girl, when two years of age 
[they were Christians] would point and say "angel" "angel." Soon 
afterwards, she hit her head on the streetcar when it jerked to a 
stop and soon died from complications. 
<P>
An Christian woman who was expecting a baby was visited by an angel. The 
angel told her that the baby would be stillborn. Of course, the baby was stillborn.
<P>
The angels of apocalypse dump fire, plagues and all other kinds of 
nasties on humanity. 
<P>Angels prey upon children, and take their souls to use for hosting energy that angels and other ET entities feed off of.
