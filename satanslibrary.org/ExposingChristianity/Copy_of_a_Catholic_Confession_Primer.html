<P>This is pathetic, but makes for a good laugh.
This is a copy of a Catholic confession primer. Humor aside, in reading this, it is more than obvious that these people are seriously SICK.</P>
 
<P> This is so anti-life and a perfect example of how the alien "God" hates humanity and anything human. Every human trait is covered here; what makes us all human. These tenets are so anti-human and alien. What is worse, is how they push these sick teachings on innocent children and destroy more lives. This sick "religion" needs to come to an end  and soon is not soon enough!</P>
