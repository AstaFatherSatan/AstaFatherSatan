Here is some humor [Jehova's Witnesses] quotes from
their material and the Watchtower and Awake! Magazines:
<P>
1877- THE END OF THIS WORLD...is nearer than most men suppose
* from the book: "Three Worlds and the Harvest of this
World" Jehova's Witnesses and Prophetic Speculation;
1877
<P>
1889- In subsequent chapters we present proofs that
the setting up of the Kingdom of God has already
begun...And that the "battle of the great day of God
almighty [revelation 16:14], which will end in A.D.
1914 with the complete overthrow of the earth's present rulership, is already commenced. [The 1915
edition of this book changed "A.D. 1914" to "A.D.
1915."]
*from the book "The Time is at Hand; 1889
<P>
July 15th 1894- We see no reason for changing the
futures- nor could we change them if we would. They
are, we believe God's dates, not ours. But bear in
mind that the end of 1914 is not the date for the
beginning, but for the end of the time of trouble.
<P>
1904- The stress of the great time of trouble will be
on us soon, somewhere between 1910 and 1912- culminating in the end of the "Times of the Gentiles,"
October 1914.
*from the book "The New Creation" 1904
<P>
May 1st, 1914- There is absolutely no ground for bible
students to question that the consummation of this
gospel age is now even at the door...The great
crisis...that will consume the ecclesiastical heavens
and the social earth is very near. 
*Watchtower reprints
<P>
When the 1914 events did not occur, they were rescheduled for 1918-1925
<P>
The book "The Finished Mystery" Armageddon was to begin "in the spring of 1918" There was to be "worldwide all-embracing anarchy" in the "fall of
1920." The 1917 edition asserts that Revelation 11:13
would be fulfilled "early in 1918" ["the earthquake"]
and in the "fall of 1920" [the fire]. The 1926 edition
is again altered. 
<P>
The Watchtower- Sept 1st, 1922: "The date 1925 is even
more distinctly indicated by the scriptures because it
is fixed by the law of God to Israel..."
<P>
Watchtower- April 1st, 1923: "Our thought is that 1925
is definitely settled by the scriptures."
<P>
So what happened when 1925 arrived??
<P>
Watchtower- Jan 1st 1925: "With great expectation,
Christians have looked forward to this year. Many
have been confidently expected that all members of the
body of Christ will be changed to heavenly glory
during this year. This may be accomplished. It may not
be. "
<P>
What happened at the end of 1925??
<P>
Watchtower- Sept 1925: "It is to be expected that
Satan will try to inject into the minds of the
consecrated the thought that 1925 should see an end of
the work, and therefore it would be needless for them
to do no more."
<P>
<I>**All of a sudden Satan, not "God" is the one
prophesying.</I>
<P>
1930- "The great climax is at hand"
<P>
1931- "God's kingdom has begun to operate. His day of
vengeance is here and Armageddon is at hand."
<P>
1933- "The overwhelming testimony of the prophesy and
of the supporting facts shows the cleansing of the
sanctuary has been accomplished and this indicates
that Armageddon draws nigh.
<P>
1939- "The battle of the great day of God almighty is
very near"
<P>
There were 44 more predictions; 42 from the
Watchtower, from May 1940- April 1943.   
<P>
Sept 1, 1944- "Armageddon is near at hand."
<P>
1946- [After WWII] "The disaster of Armageddon...is at
the door."
<P>
1950- "The March is on! Where? To the field of
Armageddon for the 'war of the great day of God
almighty.' "
<P>
1953- "Armageddon is so near at hand, it will strike
the generation now living" 
*The year 1954 was thought by many Witnesses to be
"The Year."
<P>
1955- "It has become clear that the war of Armageddon
is near its breaking out point."
<P>
1958- "When will Armageddon be fought? Jehova the
great time keeper has scheduled Armageddon to come at
the close of the "time of the end." That time is near.
How hear?...No man knows the date but we know it will
be very soon. How do we know it will be very soon?
Because the time left for the Devil, now that Christ
has hurled the Devil down to earth, is called 'a short
period of time' [revelation 12:12]
<P>
Awake! October 1968:
Stated that "certain persons" had falsely predicted
the end of the world, and what they lacked was "God's
guidance."
<P>
*But now, supposedly, this false prophesying is over:
<P>
1971: They have "all the evidence" and that God is
"guiding them." and "it is overwhelming." Now
Armageddon will occur in 1975.
<P>
1972: "In the mind of the average Witness, there is no
doubt that the 1975 date is correct."
<P>
1976 Watchtower: 
March 15th- "Reconciliation through God's mercy before
Armageddon"
<P>
September 22nd- "a global disaster unparalleled in
human history, is very near." 
  <P>
December 15th- "Hold on, the promise nears
fulfillment"
<P>
1979 Watchtower:
June 15th- "A day of reckoning at hand"
<P>
Oct 15th "Take courage, the millennium is at hand"
<P>
November 1st- "Christian neutrality as God's war approaches." 

<P>A psychiatrist remarked that there is a psychiatric hospital they refer to as "the watchtower" as it is full of so many Jehova's Witnesses.
