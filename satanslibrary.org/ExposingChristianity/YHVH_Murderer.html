<P>Exodus 15:3 <BR>The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.



<P>The real truth appears in the "Holy Bible" where for one, crimes against children are rampant; the most notable being the evil "God" Jehova making a living blood sacrifice of his son, [child murder] which is the entire theme of the Christian mass/service; a simulated living blood sacrifice, proving who he really is. For more detailed information, see <A HREF="../666BlackSun/ChristianMass_JewishRitualMurder.html">The Christian Mass/Service: a Simulation of a Human Blood Sacrifice </a>
 
<P>Deuteronomy 2:33
<BR>
And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. 
<BR>2:34
<BR>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain.
 
 
<P>Deuteronomy 7:23
<BR>But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed. 
<BR>7:24
<BR>And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them. 
 
<P>Exodus 23:18 
<BR>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.
 
<p>"A MURDERER AND A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING"
<p>Numbers 25:16
<BR>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<BR>25:17
<BR>Vex the Midianites, and smite them
 
<P>Numbers 31: 17-18
<BR>17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
<BR>18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
 
<P>Psalms 137:9 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
 
<P>I Samuel 15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
 
<P>IT IS NO WONDER THAT THOSE WHO TIE INTO THE HUMAN HATING, MURDEROUS ENERGY OF CHRISTIANITY COMMIT THESE CRIMES.
 
<P>THOU SHALT NOT KILL????
<BR>Luke 19:27 
<BR>But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. 
<BR>- Jesus of Nazareth, ordering others to commit murder. 
 
<p>HONOR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER????
<BR>Matthew 10: 34-36 
<BR>34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. 
<BR>35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law. 
<BR>36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. 
<BR>- Jesus of Nazareth
 
 
<P>WHO DID SATAN EVER MURDER? 
 
<P>There is nothing at all spiritual about the Bible or Christianity. There are endless contradictions and opposing verses in the Bible. These are to ensure that the Bible will adapt to all time periods and situations, in order to perpetuate the program of Christianity. Some interpolations were secretly slipped in by various ancient writers crying for help; no different from <U>UFO's in ancient art</U> [type this into Google or some other search engine]. For more about hidden messages, <A HREF="Destroying_Our_Past.html">please click here.</a>
 
<P>The above is only a very small sample of the endless murder, torture, butchery of children and infants, and other abominable crimes committed on the orders of Jehova, and YES, Jesus the Nazarene. This, along with endless suicidal advice is the theme of the Bible. Do not be fooled or deceived at the Christian attempts to confuse you. 
 
<P>"SATAN" means "TRUTH" in Sanskrit. Satan does not contradict himself. Even an attorney in court proves guilt by the contradicitons of the defendant. A REAL LIAR AND DECEIVER CONTRADICTS HIM/HERSELF! 
 
<P>"We Shall Destroy God" - The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion.
<P>"Satan" means "enemy" in Hebrew.


<p><BR><i>Rabbi Yaacov Perrin says, "One million Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail." (NY Daily News, Feb. 28, 1994, p.6). </i>



<P><BR>MASS MURDER OF GENTILES:
<BR>Exodus 15:3 <BR>The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.
<P>Exodus 17:13   <BR>And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
<BR>17:14   <BR>And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
<BR>17:15   <BR>And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:
<BR>17:16   <BR>For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

<P>"JEHOVA COMMITS MORE MURDER:
<BR>Exodus 23:27 
<BR>I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
<p><br><i>Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburg declared, "We have to recognize that Jewish blood and the blood of a goy are not the same thing." (NY Times, June 6, 1989, p.5).</i> 
<br>("goy" or "goyim" - plural, are Jewish derogatory words for "Gentile/s" the root "goeti" is the root word of "Devil." Satan is the God of the Gentiles and our True Creator God. "Satan" means "enemy" in Hebrew.

<P>"JEHOVA" ORDERS THE MASS MURDER OF THOUSANDS OF GENTILES:
<BR>Exodus 32:27 
<BR>And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.

<BR>32:28 
<BR>And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

<P>"JEHOVA" ORDERS HIS PEOPLE TO COMMIT MORE MURDER OF GENTILES:
<BR>Leviticus 26:7 
<BR>And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
 
<BR>26:8<BR> 
And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.

<p><br><i>Univ. of Jerusalem Prof. Ehud Sprinzak described Kahane and Goldstein's philosophy: "They believe it's God's will that they commit violence against 'goyim,' a Hebrew term for non-Jews." (NY Daily News, Feb. 26, 1994, p. 5). </I>


<P>MORE MASS MURDER OF THE GENTILE CANAANITES:"
<BR>Numbers 21:3<BR> 
And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.

<P>HERE IS CANNIBALISM- EATING DEAD GENTILES:
<BR>Numbers 23-24:
<BR>
Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

<p><br>QUOTE FROM THE JEWISH TALMUD: <i>Sanhedrin 59a: "Murdering Goyim is like killing a wild animal." </i>


<P>GENOCIDE OF THE GENTILE MIDIANITES:
<BR>Numbers 25:16<BR> 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<BR>25:17<BR> 
Vex the Midianites, and smite them:

<P>Numbers 31:7 
<BR>And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.
<P><br>QUOTE FROM THE JEWISH TALMUD:
<br><i>18. Tosefta. Aboda Zara B, 5: "If a goy kills a goy or a Jew, he is responsible; but if a Jew kills a goy, he is NOT responsible."</I>


<BR>31:8<BR> 
And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
<p><br>QUOTES FROM THE JEWISH TALMUD: <I>Yebhamoth 11b: "Sexual intercourse with a little girl is permitted if she is three years of age."
<BR>Nidrasch Talpioth, p. 225-L: "Jehovah created the non-Jew in human form so that the Jew would not have to be served by beasts. The non-Jew is consequently an animal in human form, and condemned to serve the Jew day and night."
</i>   

<p>MAKING SLAVES OF THE GENTILE WOMEN AND CHILDREN: 
<BR>31:9<BR> 
And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.

<BR>31:10<BR> 
And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.

<BR>31:11<BR> 
And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.
<p><br>QUOTE FROM THE JEWISH TALMUD:
<br><i>Schulchan Aruch, Choszen Hamiszpat 348: "All property of other nations belongs to the Jewish nation, which, consequently, is entitled to seize upon it without any scruples."</i>
<P>MORE MASS MURDER AND GENOCIDE OF GENTILES. THE TAKING OF ALL GENTILE PROPERTY IS A BLATANT EXAMPLE OF WHAT WAS DONE TO MODERN DAY PALESTINE (DESCENDED FROM THE PHILISTINES) BY THE BANDIT STATE OF ISRAEL:

<BR> Deuteronomy 2:20 
<BR>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
  

<BR>2:21<BR> 
A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:

<BR>2:22<BR> 
As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:

<BR>2:23<BR> 
And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)

<p><br>QUOTE FROM THE JEWISH TALMUD: <i>Hilkkoth Akum X1: "Show no mercy to the Goyim."</i>

<BR>2:30<BR> 
But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.

<BR>2:31<BR> 
And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.

<BR>2:32<BR> 
Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
   
  
<BR>2:33<BR> 
And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.

<BR>2:34<BR> 
And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:
<P><br>QUOTE FROM THE JEWISH TALMUD: <br><i>Seph. Jp., 92, 1: "God has given the Jews power over the possessions and blood of all nations."</I>
<BR>2:35<BR> 
Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
 
<p><i><br>QUOTE FROM THE JEWISH TALMUD:
<BR>Sanhedrin 57a. "When a Jew murders a Gentile ("Cuthean"), there will be no death penalty. What a Jew steals from a Gentile he may keep." 
<br>
Baba Kamma 37b. Gentiles are outside the protection of the law and God has "exposed their money to Israel." 
</i>

 
<P>2:36<BR> 
From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:

<BR>2:37<BR> 
Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us. 

<p>THE HITTITES, THE GIRGASHITES, THE AMORITES, THE CANAANITES, THE PERIZZITES, THE HIVITES, AND THE JESUBITES ARE ALL GENTILE NATIONS. 
<BR> Deuteronomy   7:1 
<BR>When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;
  

<BR>7:2<BR> 
And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:


<BR>7:3<BR> 
Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.
  
<BR>
7:4 <BR>
For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.

<P>HERE IS WHERE THE JEWS ARE BLATANT ABOUT DESTROYING THE GENTILE GODS:

<BR> 
7:5 <BR>
But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.
 
<BR>7:6<BR> 
For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.

<P>Deuteronomy 7:21 
<BR>Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.

<BR>7:22<BR> 
And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.

<BR>7:23<BR> 
But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.

<BR>7:24<BR> 
And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

<P><br>The Gentiles have been indoctrinated with Jewish lies. We have been disconnected from our gods and our culture. These have been replaced with fictitious Jewish characters for Gentiles to slavishly worship, which creates a powerful subliminal connection. This sort of thing is responsible for how Gentiles are always fighting wars for the Jews and not even thinking of what they are really doing. What has happened in Iraq is a perfect example.



<P><br>Deuteronomy 7:25<BR> 
The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.

<BR>7:26<BR> 
Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing. 



<P>Deuteronomy 12:27 
<BR>And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.

<BR>12:28<BR> 
Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.

<BR>12:29<BR> 
When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;

<BR>12:30<BR> 
Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.



<P>Human energy is not enough, there had to be animal blood sacrifices as well:
<BR>Exodus 20:24 
<BR>An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

<P>Exodus 24:4 <BR>
And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

<BR>24:5 <BR>
And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.

<BR>24:6 <BR>
And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

<BR>24:7 <BR>
And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.

<BR>24:8 <BR>
And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.

<P>More instructions from jehova for blood sacrifice:
<BR>Exodus 23:18 
<BR>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.


<P>Exodus 29:10 
And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.

<BR>29:11 <BR>
And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

<BR>29:12<BR> 
And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.

<BR>29:13<BR> 
And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

<BR>29:14<BR> 
But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.

<BR>29:15<BR> 
Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

<BR>29:16<BR> 
And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

<BR>29:17<BR> 
And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.

<BR>29:18<BR> 
And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

<BR>29:19<BR> 
And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

<BR>29:20<BR> 
Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

<BR>29:21<BR> 
And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.


<BR>29:22<BR> 
Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:

<BR>29:23<BR> 
And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD:

<BR>29:24<BR> 
And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.


<BR>29:25<BR> 
And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

<BR>29:26<BR> 
And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part.

 
<BR>29:27<BR> 
And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:

<BR>29:28<BR> 
And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.

<BR>29:29<BR> 
And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

<BR>29:30<BR> 
And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.

<BR>29:31<BR> 
And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.

<p> Leviticus  Chapter 1 
<BR>1:1<BR> 
And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

<BR>1:2 <BR>
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.


<BR>1:3<BR> 
If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.

<BR>1:4<BR> 
And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

 
<BR>1:5<BR> 
And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

<BR>1:6<BR> 
And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.

<BR>1:7<BR> 
And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:

<BR>1:8<BR> 
And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:

<BR>1:9<BR> 
But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of "a sweet savour unto the LORD".


<BR>1:10<BR> 
And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.

 
<BR>1:11<BR> 
And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.

<BR>1:12<BR> 
And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
 

<BR>1:13<BR> 
But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

<BR>1:14<BR> 
And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.

  
<BR>1:15<BR> 
And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:

<BR>1:16<BR> 
And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:
 

<BR>1:17<BR> 
And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 

<P>Leviticus  Chapter 7 

 
<BR>7:1<BR> 
Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.

<BR>7:2<BR> 
In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.

<BR>7:3<BR> 
And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,

<BR>7:4<BR> 
And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:

<BR>7:5<BR> 
And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.

<P>Leviticus 7:14 
<BR>And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.

<P>THE "LORD" NEEDS EVERY DROP OF THAT BLOOD FROM THE BLOOD SACRIFICE:
<BR>Leviticus 7:27 
<BR>Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

<P>Here, more blood sacrifice is needed to remove the curse of leprosy jehova has inflicted:

<BR>Leviticus 14:34<BR> 
<BR>When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;

<BR>14:49<BR> 
And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

<BR>14:50<BR> 
And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
 
<BR>14:51<BR> 
And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:

<BR>14:52<BR> 
And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

<BR>14:53<BR> 
But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.

<BR>14:54<BR> 
This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,

<BR>14:55<BR> 
And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

<BR>14:56<BR> 
And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

<BR>14:57<BR> 
To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.
