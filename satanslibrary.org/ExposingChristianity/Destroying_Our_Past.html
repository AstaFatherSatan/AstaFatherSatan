Most of us here know Christianity is a 
hoax, but to what extent is another matter. It is a hoax of catastrophic 
proportions. A study of Medieval Paintings reveals a cry for help. Many of the 
artists of the period left messages in their work. There are quite a few 
paintings- all of Christian religious matter (this was not an option of the 
artist as the Catholic Church had total control, and nearly every work of art 
during that period had to be of Christian religious themes, lest the artist be 
charged with "heresy" which meant torture and death) that reveal flying saucers 
hovering over the nazarene and other signs that this foul religion was a hoax 
and the people knew it, but were severely oppressed. Grey clouds obscuring the 
Sun in the painting "Calling of the first Apostles" by Domenico Ghirlandaio, 
1481, reveals a dismal atmosphere that indicates a sad occasion and says plenty. 
Carlo Crivelli's painting of the Annunciation in 1486 blatantly reveals a UFO 
hovering over the virgin and beaming a stream of light into her head. Many 
artists alluded to flying saucers, by painting lenticular clouds in the skies of 
their works. 
<P>Leonardo's famous "Last Supper" painting displays the apostles of the 
nazarene in four groups of three, indicating the signs of the zodiac and the 
implication is- he knew Christianity was a hoax. Many other paintings of the 
period have hidden messages in them concerning the hoax of Christianity, if one 
takes the time to study them. 
<P>There have been several reports of which I posted links with the details at 
the bottom of the page, of the Smithsonian Institute dumping barges full of 
ancient artifacts into the Atlantic Ocean. Many of these were Egyptian in origin 
and found in the United States. Anything that disputes the Christian religion 
comes under intense scrutiny. Since the Jews, Christians and Muslims claim the 
world to be only approximately 6,000 years old, there has always been a conflict 
with the truth in promoting this lie. 
<P>Anyone with even half a brain knows there were no "Weapons of Mass 
Destruction" in Iraq. In spite of hundreds of worldwide protests against the 
invasion and the U.N.'s giving Iraq a clean report, George W. Bush pushed 
relentlessly for the attack on Iraq. Of course, it is just fine for Israel and 
the USA to have all the weapons of mass destruction they please with no outside 
interference whatsoever. We all know Mr. Bush is a "born again" Christian. 
<P>The real reason behind all of this seems to point towards the destruction of 
important ancient relics and documents that *prove* Judaism, and Christianity 
are lies. Saddam Hussein believed himself to be the reincarnation of 
Nebuchadnezzar. With this belief, he spent some $500 million dollars during the 
1980's attempting to reconstruct Ancient Babylon, the capitol of Nebuchadnezzar. 
Over sixty million bricks were created to replace the walls of Babylon with the 
engraving "To King Nebuchadnezzar in the reign of Saddam Hussein." ¹ 
<P>There were many ancient temples and relics buried beneath the sands of Iraq 
that were proof of the origins of humanity. Whether they are still there given 
the invasion is unknown. American and British GI's were given the go ahead from 
the top brass to destroy and/or loot whatever they pleased from the Iraqi 
museums. 
<P>Saddam Hussein was also working on restoring the Ancient Ashurbanipal 
Library, which was the earliest known collected and catalogued library in the 
world. The texts therein originated before the flood. British archeologists in 
the mid 19th century at Nineveh excavated some 25,000 cuneiform tablets 
assembled by King Ashurbanipal which nearly all of are now in the British 
Museum. 
<P>In April of 2002, the Iraqi archeologists asked the British Museum if they 
would allow casts of the tablets to be made. Though copies were made in the past 
of certain tablets, this would have been the first time any significant number 
would have been made available as copies. 
<P>The proposed reconstructed library at Nineveh would have held copies of all 
of the tablets from the British Museum and was planned to be a center for 
scholars and a tourist attraction. Next door to the library was to be a center 
for cuneiform study. Plans were also made to excavate one of the wings of King 
Ashurbanipal's Palace in Kuyunjik Mound where it was hoped that thousands of 
other buried tablets would be found. 
<P>There are some 10,000 archeological sites scattered across Iraq and most of 
them have not even been touched. According to archeologists, thieves have broken 
into the Iraqi Museums repeatedly and have stolen Sumerian artifacts (This 
occurred before the war as well). Expensive gold jewelry and ornaments were left 
behind. What they went after were the ancient records in the form of cylinders 
and cuneiform tablets. 
<P>U.N. relief workers and foreign diplomats were several times accused by the 
Iraqi government of smuggling these artifacts out of the country. In summer of 
2002, an Iraqi landlord was cleaning a vacant Baghdad apartment that was 
formerly occupied by a foreign diplomat. The landlord found two cartons of 
archeological fragments. The Iraqi government never named the diplomat or his 
country. 
<P>"Saddam assuredly knows that the release of documentation proving Judaism and 
Christianity as derivatives or copies of an ancient Sumerian religion could have 
a devastating effect on global affairs."² 
<P>"When George W. Bush stood before the Washington Monument in January 2001, 
during his inauguration he borrowed a surprising image from the past. Referring 
to America twice he said: And an angel still rides the whirlwinds and directs 
this storm." 
<P>Throughout the ages after the manifestation of Judaism and Christianity, 
every attempt has been made from mass murder to the destruction and razing of 
entire cities and the genocide of entire peoples to keep the lid on this lie. 
The "Devil" *not* the Judeo/Christian "God" was the creator of humanity. 
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Parts of the above information were taken from the book: 
<P>¹ "Cloak of the Illuminati" by William Henry, 2003. The author has a lot of 
useful information if one can read between the lines, but is seriously deluded 
as to the nazarene. The nazarene as we all know is fictitious. As for the 
virgin, this entity stole everything from Astaroth while Astaroth was bound.

<P>Excerpts from links below concerning Archeological Cover ups: 
<P>"Smithsonian at one time had actually taken a barge full of unusual artifacts 
out into the Atlantic and dumped them in the ocean." 
<P>"Historian and linguist Carl Hart, editor of WORLD EXPLORER, then obtained a 
hiker's map of the Grand Canyon from a bookstore in Chicago. Poring over the 
map, we were amazed to see that much of the area on the north side of the canyon 
has Egyptian names. The area around Ninety-four Mile Creek and Trinity Creek had 
areas (rock formations, apparently) with names like Tower of Set, Tower of Ra, 
Horus Temple, Osiris Temple, and Isis Temple. In the Haunted Canyon area were 
such names as the Cheops Pyramid, the Buddha Cloister, Buddha Temple, Manu 
Temple and Shiva Temple. Was there any relationship between these places and the 
alleged Egyptian discoveries in the Grand Canyon?" 
<P>"The Smithsonian" <BR>"The 1909 article clearly states that the Smithsonian 
is involved with studying and excavating the site. However, the Smithsonian 
denies that any such discovery ever occurred. This brings up the larger question 
that if this was a true story, why would the Smithsonian have covered up what 
certainly would be one of the most significant archeological finds of the 
twentieth century? Believe it or not, there is precedence for the Smithsonian 
losing information about discoveries that are deemed to not fit in with 
currently accepted dogma about the history of America and its interaction or 
lack thereof with other ancient civilizations."
