The Judeo/Christian Bible has always 
used extreme fear as a tool to keep people away from the occult, sorcery, 
"witchcraft,” and workings of the mind. In the article below, the reasons are 
obvious. In order for a spell to succeed, the victim must lack the necessary 
knowledge, be a good sheep, and just "believe." 
<P>Exodus 22:18 - "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."

<P>"YHVH" aka "Yaweh" "Jehova" is nothing more than a system of Jewish magick. 
"YHVH" known as the "tetragrammaton" represents the four corners and elements, as 
does "INRI" along with the four gospels; these represent the four corners of 
magick and the four elements that are so important in any magickal working. 
"YHVH" is used extensively in (Jewish) magick. <A 
href="stolen_kaballah.html">The Jews stole the 
Kabalah from the Egyptians and corrupted it.</A> It is mainly chanted- "Yod Heh 
Vau Heh" in different combinations. 
<P>The Gentile people have been force fed Christianity in order to strip us of 
all knowledge and power. Those at the top play both sides against the middle. 
What this means is the enemy works from within both sides- each side bashing the 
other while they both move ahead. This is analogous to a cop who is heavily 
involved in an open and public anti-drug crusade and secretly sells and pushes 
drugs unbeknownst to his family and community. 
<P>Following the Roman sacking of the Temple of Solomon 70 CE, Christianity was 
invented by the Jews the best known is (Paul aka "Saul of Tarsus) so they could 
control the world using the ancient known powers of the mind and the soul. The 
Jews themselves know the Nazarene is a fictitious character based upon some 20 
crucified heroes from Pagan pantheons. With the centuries of devout belief in 
this entity and the psychic energy poured into him through prayer, he has taken 
on a life of his own. See <A 
href="../../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Thoughtform.html">Thoughtforms.</A> For 
example, Odin hung from a tree, Set was crucified on a furka, Buddha sat beneath 
the Bo (Boa- again the serpent) tree for enlightenment; the list goes on. Most 
of the character of the Nazarene was stolen from the Persian God "Mithra." In 
working a spell, it is always important a connection be made. 
<P>In the case of Christianity, all of the former Pagan (Gentile) Gods were 
bound and replaced with fictitious Jewish deities. The Hebrew Virgin Mary 
replaced <A 
href="../../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Astaroth.html">Astaroth,</A> 
the Hebrew Moses legend was stolen from Sargon (both were born in secrecy, left 
in a reed basket to float down the river and adopted by royalty), Hebrew Abraham 
was stolen from Hindu Brahma. Brahma in Sanskrit means "many." The endless list 
goes on and on. See <A href="EXPOSING_CHRISTIANITY_MAIN.html">Exposing 
Christianity</A> There isn't anything in the Christian religion that hasn't been 
stolen from Pagan religions pre-dating it from hundreds to thousands of years. 
The Pagan Gods, being a powerful racial memory in the minds of Gentiles were 
replaced with Hebrew characters to be slavishly obeyed and worshipped. This set 
the stage for immense power and control. 
<P>Christianity has always been nothing more than a tool to remove spiritual 
knowledge and power from the Gentile population and to keep us from our Gods, 
namely our True Creator God given the name Satan, which means "adversary/enemy" 
in Hebrew. Those Gentiles who were priests and leaders were tortured and put to 
death. The others who did not follow suffered the same lot and any Gentile even 
suspected of having ties to the old religions was labeled as a "heretic" and put 
to death. Of course, the Jews rant and holler concerning the Christian Church's 
persecution of their small communities during the Middle Ages, but this is the 
age old playing both sides against the middle and those Jews at the top could 
care less how many of their own they have to use. Tomás de Torquemada, First 
Grand Inquisitor of Spain was a Jew. 
<P>The Jews have had full control of the Catholic Church (original Christian 
Church) from the beginning. Most of the Catholic popes were of Jewish origins, 
such as the late John Paul II who was born of a Jewish mother (Katz) and 
recognized as a Jew by the Jewish orthodox. Through the Catholic sacrament of confession, 
the Catholic clergy had everyone, namely the Gentile leaders and nobility over a 
barrel. They knew their deepest and darkest secrets. 
<P>The Catholic Church is the bulwark of Christianity. Since the Protestant 
reformation, the Jews have also gained control of these sects. The "World 
Council of Churches" is another example. 
<P>The Jews have had a vast pool of psychic energy from which to draw from. The 
Jews appointed themselves as "The Chosen of God," the star character of 
Christianity, <A href="Jewish_Nazarene.html">the 
Nazarene is a Jew</A> (and a powerful thoughtform), the Virgin Mary and her 
husband Joseph are Jews, the 12 apostles of the Nazarene (13 makes a coven- 
again stolen from the Ancient Pagan religions)- all Jews. In addition, all of 
the characters of the Old and New Testament were stolen from Gentile characters 
and replaced as the "Chosen" Jews. 
<P>So the average Christian Gentile, ignorant to the clandestine workings of the 
Jews and the occult, pours more and more psychic energy through devotion and 
prayer into this Jewish energy vortex and people wonder how this minority has 
most of the world's wealth and power. The Gentiles, namely the Christians have 
been under a very powerful spell for centuries. 
<P>They cut us off from our Gods, our traditions and our spiritual and religious 
heritage through mass murder, replacing our history with nothing but lies and 
through fear of the unknown since all Gentile knowledge was taken out of 
circulation. 
<P>Their angelic filth- most have names with the classic seven letters: Gabriel, 
Raphael, etc. These seven represent the seven chakras and were used to bind the 
Gentile Gods and make slaves of them using the "Goetia." The Goetic black books 
or "grimoires" all originated with the Jews, such as "The Key of Solomon," and 
"The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage" and many more, (these can easily be 
found online, by typing their titles into a search engine) all originally 
written in Hebrew as most Gentiles cannot read Hebrew. All use the Hebrew 
symbols and chants and direct intense blasphemy against the Gentile Gods who 
have been turned into devils, demons and hideous monsters to be degraded. The 
Gentile Gods are no longer bound and some of those complacent prophesies slipped 
such as "Azazel being bound until the end of time." I can assure you he is now 
totally free. 
<P>Christianity goes in steps. Because it is fictitious, it is spiritually 
unreliable. Certain Christians have at times tapped into this energy vortex and 
obtained results. Prayer groups and such put forth psychic energy. Deluded 
Christians are told to "have faith." Having faith is necessary for any spell or 
directed working of the mind to succeed. With Christianity, it is hit and mostly 
misses. The few and far in-between hits keep the deluded believing, unknowing 
this is not any "miracle" but only the power of the mind. The end objective is 
atheism. The atheist believes in nothing and disregards anything "supernatural" 
or of the occult. He/she is a sitting duck just waiting to be manipulated by 
those who possess occult knowledge and power.
