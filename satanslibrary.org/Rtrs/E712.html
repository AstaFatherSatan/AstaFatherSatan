<p>Reverse Torah Ritual: Serpent Empowerment for Gentiles<br /> <br /> <br /> The words below are to be vibrated. By vibrating these words, this will remove another powerful biblical curse. The more people we have who will be doing this ritual, the better, as there is both strength and power in numbers. We are removing the weapons from the enemy's hands. The effects of this ritual will result in full power for us Gentiles. <br /> <br /> Practice the words [I have included an mp3 of the words for you all to download], as much as you can before performing the ritual. <br /> <br /> Vibrate the following words below 18 times. What this means is vibrate each of the words below, every word from the first word to the last. That is one time. Then, vibrate the same again and again until you have done this 18 times. <br /> <br /> <br /> MAHT-OHT-AHM&ndash;TEH &bull; NOHR-HAH-AH &bull; AYT-HAM &bull; AHL-VEE-IVE &bull; MEEN-EEN-AHT-LUH &bull; UUUY-HEEY-IVE &bull; UUUH-AYT-HAM &bull; SHEEE &bull; UUUKH-EEL-SHAHY-IVE <br /> <br /> After vibrating the above paragraph 18 times, state with conviction 18 times: <br /> <br /> Vibrate AUM <br /> <br /> All obstacles are totally, permanently, and completely removed! <br /> Satan is fully empowered! <br /> Satan has Supreme and Invincible Power <br /> Satan's Supreme and Invincible Power is Forever! <br /> <br /> Vibrate AUM <br /> <br /> [*All of the above together is one round] <br /> <br /> HAIL SATAN FOREVER!! <br /> <br /> End of Ritual <br /> <br /> ____________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Key to pronouncing the words correctly: <br /> <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> AH as in the American English word father <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> AY as in the American English words day, say, made <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> EE as in the American English words seek and week <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> EH as in the American English words pet, set, and let <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> I is in the American English words eye, sigh, tie, might. <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> KH is guttural and the sound is made in the back of the throat <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> OH as in the American English words oh and go <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> R's should be rolled <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> UH as in the American English word cut and tub <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> UU as in the American English words sooth and tooth</p>
