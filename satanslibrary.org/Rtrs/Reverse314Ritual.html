<p><br/>This ritual can be repeated as many times as you wish. You can begin this ritual at any time. This ritual has already been done, but due to the weekly Torah readings repeating themselves every year beginning on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which is the Jewish New Year, it must be done again.</p>
<p>The words below are to be vibrated. By vibrating these words, this free the Serpent of Satan, as these yearly torah readings keep the Serpent of Satan cursed and bound so that humanity cannot see the truth and the populace remains brainwashed and under the control of the Jews. This will destroy the enemy. The more people we have who will be doing this ritual, the better, as there is both strength and power in numbers. This ritual may also be done as often as you like, and is a very good cathartic when you feel anger and hatred towards the enemy. All you need to do is vibrate the paragraph below 9 times. Many of the words below are guttural. This means many syllables are vibrated in the back of the throat. Just do the best that you can. Practice the words [I have included an mp3 of the words for you all to download], as much as you can before performing the ritual.</p>
<p>RAISE YOUR ENERGIES AND VIBRATE THE PARAGRAPH BELOW 9 TIMES [See Link Below]:</p>
<p>Vibrate the following paragraph of words 9 times:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AHKH-YEHY-AHKH &bull; YAIM-UHY--LAHK &bull; LAHKH-OHT &bull; RRAHFF--&lsquo;AH&rsquo;--AYV &bull;</p>
<p>KHAYL-AYT &bull; AKH-NOHKH-UHGG--&lsquo;AHL&rsquo; &bull; EHD-AHS-HAH &bull; TAHY-AHKH &bull;</p>
<p>LOHK-EEM-UU &bull; AHM-HEH-UHB-HAH--LOHK-EEM &bull; AHT-AH &bull; RR-UU-RRAH &bull;</p>
<p>T-OH-ZZ &bull; AHT-EES--&lsquo;AHH&rsquo; &bull; EEK &bull; SH-AKH-AHN-NAH--LEH &bull;</p>
<p>MEEHH-OHL-EH &bull; AHV-OH-HUHY &bull; RR-EHM-OH-YAV</p>
<p><br />Vibrate AUM<br />Then state with conviction 18 times:<br />The Serpent is free. The Serpent is exalted. The Serpent is forever!<br />Vibrate AUM</p>
<p>HAIL SATAN FOREVER!!</p>
<p>End of Ritual</p>
<p><br />Key to pronouncing the words correctly:</p>

EE as in the American English words seek and week<br />? EH as in the American English words pet, set, and let<br />? KH is guttural and the sound is made in the back of the throat<br />?
