This is the final Reverse Torah Ritual. This RTR can be performed immediately. Right now. This RTR will put an end to Christianity and its related ilk as well, as Christianity has its roots in Hebrew. This is the most important RTR. All of Jewish control and incredible wealth comes from the Hebrew aleph-bet, which has been infused with power centuries ago. The enemy has made prolific use of the Hebrew aleph-bet for centuries.  We are now reversing this.
<P>
Amdusias stated to the JoS Ministry back in 2003: 
<BR>“Just as (Jehovah’s people) cannot see you, you cannot see them, but they will manifest blatantly as the earth draws closer to the climax of our cause.”
This earth is rapidly being destroyed by the enemy. We can stop this and reverse it with these rituals. One can see how they control public opinion in the news, with their control of the media and with their false, lying, nefarious programs they promote as “religions.” 
<P>
SPECIAL THANKS TO AZAZEL WHO ORGANIZED THIS PROJECT AND GAVE US THIS KNOWLEDGE. 
Azazel stated that the former RTRs stripped the enemy of enough power to where this one will be final. There is no longer any need to do the other RTRs, as we will be destroying the power of the Hebrew letters.
Begin this RTR at any time. You will need a marker, pen, or other writing utensil to blot each of the letters out, thus destroying them. 
<P>DO THIS RTR AS MUCH AS YOU ARE ABLE TO, PREFERABLY EVERY DAY IF POSSIBLE. The full RTR requires you recite
each of the words 9 times. If you are very short for time, it is ok to recite these once each, for a shorter version of the ritual. It is most important to do this RTR frequently, as many times as you can
You will need to print this RTR, several or more full pages to do this ritual. There are several different pronunciations for most of the letters, (see bottom of this PDF, also notes at the end of certain words). There is Ashkenazi Hebrew, Sephardic Hebrew, Ancient Hebrew, Aramaic and more.  
<P>
It is strongly recommended that you listen to the Mp3 provided to hear the correct pronunciations.
