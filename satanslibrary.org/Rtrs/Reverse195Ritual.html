<P><p>Reversing the Curse for Blood Sacrifice in the Torah<br /> <br /> <br /> This ritual can be repeated as many times as you wish. You can begin this ritual at any time. <br /> <br /> This ritual is extremely important as it reverses <br /> Genesis 9:5 I will surely require your blood of your lives. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, I will require the life of man. <br /> <br /> This is the first in endless repeats regarding living blood sacrifices to that monster YHVH. Parasitic aliens require blood and the life-force of humans and animals alike. This has incited wars of all kinds [most instigated either directly or indirectly by Christians, Muslims, and Jews] and resulted in bloodbath after bloodbath of which parasitic human-hating aliens reap the energies. The Jews as we know have a long and ugly history of sacrificing innocent Gentile children on their holy days. By repeating this ritual, this will work to put an end to this hideous practice and deprive the Jews of their favor and power in the eyes of their so-called &ldquo;God.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> The words below are to be vibrated. The more people we have who will be doing this ritual, the better, as there is both strength and power in numbers. <br /> Many of the words below are guttural. This means many syllables are vibrated in the back of the throat. Just do the best that you can. Become familiar with the words [I have included an mp3 of the words for you all to download], as much as you can before performing the ritual. This ritual may also be done as often as you like, and is a very good cathartic when you feel anger and hatred towards the enemy. All you need to do is vibrate the paragraph below 9 times. Many of the words below are guttural. This means many syllables are vibrated in the back of the throat. Just do the best that you can. <br /> <br /> <br /> MAHD--&lsquo;AH&rsquo;--HAH &bull; SHEHFF-EHN-TEH &bull; SHOHR-DEH &bull; <br /> <br /> VEE-KHAH &bull; SHEE &bull; DAH-YEEM &bull; MAHD--&lsquo;AH&rsquo;--HAH &bull; <br /> <br /> DAH-YEEM-UU &bull; UUN-EHSH-EHR-DEH &bull; AH-Y-EYEKH--LOHK &bull; <br /> <br /> DAH-YEEM &bull; SHOHR-DEH &bull; MEHKH-AYT-OSH-FAHN-LL &bull; <br /> <br /> MEKH-MEED--TEH &bull; KHAH-AYV <br /> <br /> <br /> State with conviction 9 times: <br /> <br /> &bull; Vibrate AUM <br /> <br /> &bull; The blood and lives of both human beings and animals has become toxic to enemy alien agenda and the Jews. <br /> <br /> &bull; The blood and lives of both human beings and animals have ceased to be effective and have lost all of their power for the enemy alien agenda and the Jews. <br /> <br /> &bull; Vibrate AUM <br /> <br /> <br /> HAIL SATAN FOREVER!! <br /> <br /> End of Ritual <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Key to pronouncing the words correctly: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> --&lsquo;AH&rsquo;-- Glottal stop as in the American English word hour <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> AH as in the American English word father <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> AY as in the American English words day, say, made <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> EE as in the American English words seek and week <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> EH as in the American English words pet, set, and let <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> EYE as in the American English word eye, high, night <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> KH is guttural and the sound is made in the back of the throat <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> OH as in the American English words oh and go <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> R's should be rolled <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> UH as in the American English word cut and tub <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> UU as in the American English words sooth and tooth</p>
