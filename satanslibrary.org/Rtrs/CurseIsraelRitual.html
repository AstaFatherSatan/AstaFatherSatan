<p><br />This ritual can be repeated as many times as you wish. You can begin this ritual at any time. This ritual has already been done, but due to the weekly Torah readings repeating themselves every year beginning on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which is the Jewish New Year, it must be done again. We are following their weekly readings and reversing and erasing the curses.</p>
<p>The words below are to be vibrated. By vibrating these words, this will remove another powerful biblical curse. The more people we have who will be doing this ritual, the better, as there is both strength and power in numbers.</p>
<p>Many of the words below are guttural. This means many syllables are vibrated in the back of the throat. Just do the best that you can. Become familiar with the words [I have included an mp3 of the words for you all to download], as much as you can before performing the ritual. This ritual may also be done as often as you like, and is a very good cathartic when you feel anger and hatred towards the enemy. All you need to do is vibrate the paragraph below 9 times. Many of the words below are guttural. This means many syllables are vibrated in the back of the throat. Just do the best that you can.</p>
<p>AHKH-AHR-UHB &bull; YAY-EHV &bull; AHKH-EHM-USH &bull;</p>
<p>AHL-DAHG-AH-AHV &bull; AHKH-KHEHRR-AHV-AH-AHV &bull;</p>
<p>LOHD-AHG &bull; OIG-UHL &bull; AHKH-SS--'EH&rsquo;--EHV &bull;</p>
<p>AHM-AHD-AH-AHH &bull; TOKH-UHP-SHEEM--LOHK &bull; AHKH-UHV &bull;</p>
<p>UUKH-UHR-VEEN-AYV &bull; ROH-AH &bull; AHKH-EHL-AHK-MUU &bull;</p>
<p>AHKH-AYKH-RAHV-UHM &bull; AHKH-RAHV-AH-AHV</p>
<p>After vibrating the above paragraph 9 times, state with conviction 9 times:</p>
<p>&bull; Vibrate AUM<br />&bull; Those who bless Israel are cursed<br />&bull; Those who curse Israel are blessed<br />&bull; Vibrate AUM</p>
<p>HAIL SATAN FOREVER!!</p>
