<p>Reverse Torah Ritual: Holding the Enemy Accountable</p>
<p><br />This ritual can be repeated as many times as you wish. You can begin this ritual at any time.</p>
<p>The words below are to be vibrated. By vibrating these words, this will stop the Jews from blame-shifting and force them to pay for their crimes against humanity, along with their criminal Gentile lackeys. This will destroy the enemy. The more people we have who will be doing this ritual, the better, as there is both strength and power in numbers.<br />This ritual may also be done as often as you like, and is a very good cathartic when you feel anger and hatred towards the enemy. All you need to do is vibrate the paragraph below 9 times. Many of the words below are guttural. This means many syllables are vibrated in the back of the throat. Just do the best that you can. Practice the words [I have included an mp3 of the words for you all to download], as much as you can before performing the ritual.</p>
<p>RAISE YOUR ENERGIES AND VIBRATE THE PARAGRAPH BELOW 9 TIMES:</p>
<p>uhss &bull; hahgg &bull; ahgg &bull; sheeb &bull; mah&rsquo;-ah &bull; lohkh-uhl &bull;</p>
<p>&bull; eek &bull; mahkh-oht-uhb &bull; rahg-ahh &bull; rayg-ahl-uhv &bull;</p>
<p>&bull; lay-ahr-sssee'-yh &bull; yayn-uhb &bull; lohkh-uhl &bull; khahl-seen-uhv</p>
<p>Vibrate SATANAS<br />After vibrating SATANAS, state the following paragraph with conviction 9 times:</p>
<p>The Jewish people and the Gentiles who knowingly and purposely aid and abet them in their crimes against humanity are all being held accountable. The Jewish people and their Gentile lackeys are being severely punished for all of these crimes and many more.</p>
<p>When you have stated the above 9 times, then<br />Vibrate SATANAS<br />Vibrate AUM<br />and State: HAIL SATAN FOREVER!!</p>
