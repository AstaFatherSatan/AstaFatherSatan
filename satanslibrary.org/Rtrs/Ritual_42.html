This ritual can be repeated as many times as you wish. You can begin this ritual at any time. This ritual is the most powerful we are doing so far and was directly from Satan in that he directed me to this.
<P>
The words below are to be vibrated. By vibrating these words, this will strip the Jews of both protection and power. The more people we have who will be doing this ritual, the better, as there is both strength and power in numbers. 
<p>This ritual should be done as often as you are able to, and is a very good cathartic when you feel anger and hatred towards the enemy. All you need to do is vibrate the paragraph below 6 times. 
<p>A couple of the words below are guttural. This means the KH syllables are vibrated in the back of the throat. Just do the best that you can. Practice the words [I have included an mp3 of the words for you all to download], as much as you can before performing the ritual. 
<P>
RAISE YOUR ENERGIES AND VIBRATE THE PARAGRAPH BELOW 6 TIMES:
<P><BR>
AHT-<B>OH</B>YUH   •   AHTZUHV   •    OHK   •   AHSH   •   KOHZ   •   EHP   •

<P>UHL   •   AYG   •   <B>OH</B>YUH   •   AH   •   AHN   •   UUT   •   VOHK   •   

<P>EHKH   •   GAHT   •   EE-TZAHR   •   AHT   •   AHV   •   AYHSH   •    

<P>UKH-EEYUH   •   UH-DEEG   •   AHN   •   SH-AH-EE-TAHN   •    AH    •   

<P>EER   •   OHK   •   UHTZAHT   •   <B>OH</B>YUH   •   UHG   •   UHB   •   AHH
<P><BR>

Vibrate SATANAS

<P>After vibrating SATANAS, state with conviction 6 times:

<P>•	The Jews have lost all protection
<P>•	The Gates of Satan have permanently opened wide
<P>•	Gentiles are reacting against the Jews
<P>•	The Jews have lost all of their influence over Gentiles
<P>•	The Jews have lost all of their powers to control events 
<P>•	The Jews have lost all of their power, control, and influence over the world

<P><BR>
<P>Vibrate SATANAS
<P>Vibrate AUM
<P>
HAIL SATAN FOREVER!!
<P><BR>_______________________________________________________
