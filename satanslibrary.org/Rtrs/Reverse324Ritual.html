(Also known as "SERPENT IS FREE RTR" in the forums.)
<BR>
<P>This ritual can be repeated as many times as you wish. You can begin this ritual at any time. This ritual has already been done, but due to the weekly Torah readings repeating themselves every year beginning on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which is the Jewish New Year, it must be done again. We are following their weekly readings and reversing and erasing the curses. <br /> <br /> Genesis 3:24- So he drove out the man; and he placed Keruvs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life. <br /> <br /> The words below are to be vibrated. By vibrating these words, this will remove another powerful biblical curse. The more people we have who will be doing this ritual, the better, as there is both strength and power in numbers. The effects of this ritual will result in a worldwide awakening through removing obstacles placed by the enemy upon the Serpent, that keep the Serpent bound. This ritual will result in many people worldwide seeing the truth. <br /> <br /> Many of the words below are guttural. This means many syllables are vibrated in the back of the throat. Just do the best that you can. Become familiar with the words [I have included an mp3 of the words for you all to download], as much as you can before performing the ritual. This ritual may also be done as often as you like, and is a very good cathartic when you feel anger and hatred towards the enemy. All you need to do is vibrate the paragraph below 9 times. Many of the words below are guttural. This means many syllables are vibrated in the back of the throat. Just do the best that you can. <br /> <br /> We have found that the kabalistic letter &ldquo;S&rdquo; is to be hissed, regardless of the language. <br /> <br /> <br /> RAISE YOUR ENERGIES AND VIBRATE THE PARAGRAPH BELOW 9 TIMES: <br /> <br /> SSSS &bull; MEEY-UHY-EYEKH-HAH &bull; TSAY &bull; KHEHR-EHD-TEH &bull; <br /> <br /> ROARM-SSHHEELL &bull; TEHKH-EHP-HAH-TEEM-HAH &bull; <br /> <br /> VEH-RR-EHKH-HAH &bull; TAH-AHL &bull; TAY-YAV &bull; <br /> <br /> MEEV-UURR-KHAH--TEH &bull; NEHD-AY--NAHG-LL &bull; <br /> <br /> MEHD-EHK-EEM &bull; NAYK-SHAY-AHV &bull; MAHD-AH-HAH--TEH &bull; <br /> <br /> SSHH-EHR-AHG-EYEV <br /> <br /> State with conviction 18 times: <br /> <br /> &bull; Vibrate AUM <br /> &bull; MEEV-UURR-KHAH <br /> &bull; The Serpent is free. The Serpent is rising. The Serpent is risen forever! <br /> &bull; Vibrate AUM <br /> <br /> HAIL SATAN FOREVER!! <br /> <br /> End of Ritual <br /> <br /> <br /> Key to pronouncing the words correctly: <br /> <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> AH as in the American English word father <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> AY as in the American English words day, say, made <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> EE as in the American English words seek and week <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> EH as in the American English words pet, set, and let <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> EYE as in the American English word eye, high, night <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> KH is guttural and the sound is made in the back of the throat <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> OH as in the American English words oh and go <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> R's should be rolled <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> UH as in the American English word cut and tub <br /> <span style="font-family: Symbol;">&sect;</span> UU as in the American English words sooth and tooth</p>
