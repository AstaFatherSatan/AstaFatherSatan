The following are <B>excerpts</B> from the "White Man’s Bible" and "Nature's Eternal Religion" both written by Ben Klassen. Though written from an atheist perspective, one can readily see truths concerning the hoax of Christianity. The trouble is, atheists are unaware of psychic powers and how they can be used to make people fall for this lie:

<P>About 100 B.C. a small Jewish sect, called the Essenes,
originated around the area of the Dead Sea. This sect promoted ideas of self-debasement that
were highly suicidal to those who embraced this creed. Toward the end of the first century C.E.
this teaching evolved into Christianity, but still a purely Jewish cult. It was regarded as a
subversive and destructive movement by the mainstream of the Jewish leaders and was opposed
and persecuted by them. Among the persecutors of the Christian cult was one Saul of Tarsus, a
Jew, who later became Christianity’s St. Paul. One day while persecuting (Jewish) Christians,
he conceived the brilliant idea of humbling and destroying the mighty Roman Empire by selling
this suicidal creed, Christianity, to the Gentiles.
<P>
This idea was the most significant turning point in
history. No plague, series of plagues, wars, or disasters during the next two thousand years has
wreaked more horrible calamity on the White Race of the world than what happened next.
So well did Saul of Tarsus do his job that he was soon joined and backed by the entire Jewish
network in selling these suicidal teachings to the Romans. The Jews went about it with a
vengeance, feeding the Romans such idiotic and self destructive ideas as “love your enemies”,
“turn the other cheek”, “sell all thou hast and give it to the poor”, “resist not evil”, “judge not”
and much other suicidal advice.
<P><I>
[To add to this, the Jews kept the ancient knowledge of mind power and energy manipulation and used this to further push the ludicrous xian ideas on the gentile peoples, while all of the time working to remove this knowledge from the gentile populace and cut us off from our Gods. The Nazarene was invented to distract and nothing more. People put their faith in the idea of salvation through the Nazarene while forfeiting all of their own powers. Through generations, the Gentile soul has been stripped of all psychic power while those Jews and their Catholic/Jesuit gentile stooges at the top have kept theirs and the ancient knowledge that enables them to use these powers to enslave the masses.]</I>
<P>
<B>Christ Never Existed.</B><BR> Jesus Christ did not
invent or found Christianity. All evidence that can be gleaned from a scholarly examination of
authentic history points to an obvious conclusion: there never was any Jesus Christ roaming
about in 30 A.D. or thereabouts teaching a new religion. The whole story was invented and concocted much
later. It was patched together out of fables, myths, bits and pieces of other religions, until finally
they had a movement going that pulled in the Roman Emperor Constantine. It was this Roman
Emperor, who had the mind of a criminal, (he murdered his own wife and son, and thousands of
others) who in the year 313 A.D. really put Christianity into business. The Romans, who had
always been extremely tolerant to all religions, were now told by an edict of Emperor
Constantine that Christianity was now the supreme religion of the empire to the exclusion of all
others. <P>The beginning of the Christian era found Rome near the height of her civilization. Her supremacy, in the then known world, was
pretty much unchallenged and it was the beginning of a long period of peace. To be specific, Pax Romana (Roman Peace)
lasted approximately 200 years beginning with the reign of Caesar Augustus. Rome was highly literate, there were many great
writers, scholars, historians, sculptors and painters, not to mention other outstanding men of philosophy and learning.
Yet it is highly strange that despite the great commotion and fanfare that supposedly heralded the birth of Christ and also his
crucifixion (according to the bible), we find not a single historian nor a single writer of the era who found time to tale note of it in
their writings. Outside of the fabricated biblical writings, no Roman historian, no Roman writer, and no Roman play-writer, has
left the slightest hint that he had the faintest awareness that this supposedly greatest of all greats was in their very midst and
preaching what is claimed the greatest of all the new gospels.
Whereas Caesar left voluminous writings that are still extant today and can be studied by our high school boys and girls, Christ
himself, who had supposedly the greatest message to deliver to posterity that the world has ever known, left not the slightest
scrap of paper on which he had written a single word. This, in fact, the biblical literature itself confirms and mentions only that
once he did write in the sand.<P>
Today we can still study Cicero;s great orations and writings. He has left over 800 letters behind that we can study to this day.
We can study whole books of what Marcus Aurelius wrote, we can study what Aristotle wrote, what Plato wrote, and scores of
others wrote that were contemporary with the first beginning of the Christian era, or preceded it. But strangely there is not a
word that is in writing that can be attributed to Jesus Christ himself.
Furthermore, the Greeks and the Romans of that era, and even previously and afterwards, had developed the art of sculpturing
to a fine state. We can find busts of Cicero, of Caesar, Of Marcus Aurelius and innumerable other Greek and Roman
dignitaries and lesser lights, but nor one seemed to think it important enough to sculpture a likeness of Jesus Christ. And the
reason undoubtedly is there was none to model at the time. There were undoubtedly numerous skilled artists and painters at
that time, but again strangely enough none took the time or the interest to paint a likeness of this purportedly greatest of all
teachers, who in fact was proclaimed the "Son of God" come to earth. But no painting was ever made of this man, who, we are
told, gathered great multitudes around him and caused great consternation and fear even to King Herod of Judea himself.
Now all of this is very, very strange, when, if, as the Bible claims, the birth of Jesus Christ was ushered in with great fanfare
and great proclamations. Angels proclaimed his birth. An exceedingly bright star pointed to his place of birth. In Matthew 2:3, it
says, "When Herod, the king, had heard of these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him." We can hardly gather
from this that no one was aware of the fact that the King of the Jews, the great Messiah, was born, for we are told in the
preceding verse that the Wise Men came to King Herod himself saying, "Where is he that is born King of the Jews, for we have
seen his star in the East and we are come to worship him." Evidently the event was even lit up with a bright star from heaven.<P>
In any case, King Herod, we are told in Matthew 3, was so worried that he sent the Wise Men to Bethlehem to search diligently for
the young child to bring it to him so he undoubtedly could have him put to death. As the story further unfolds we learn that
Joseph heard of this and quietly slipped out in the night taking with him his wife, the young child and a donkey and departed for
Egypt. When Herod found out that he had been tricked it says that he "was exceedingly wroth and sent forth and slew all
children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under."
Now this is a tremendously drastic act for a King to take, that is, to have murdered all the children in the land that were under
two years of age. Again we can hardly say that the birth of Jesus was unheralded, unannounced and unobserved, according to
the story in the bible. However, it is very, very strange that this act of Herod, as drastic and criminally harsh as it is, is nowhere
else recorded in the histories or writings of any of the other numerous writers of the times. All we have is the claims of those
people who wrote the New Testament. In fact, whoever wrote the New Testament invented so many claims that are
inconsistent with the facts that they even made a rather glaring error by pulling King Herod into the story. History tells us that in
the year 1 C.E. When Christ was supposedly born, Herod had already been dead for four years. He could hardly been
disturbed or very wroth about the birth of anybody in the year 1 C.E.
There is further great evidence that Matthew, Mark, Luke and John never wrote any of those chapters that are supposedly
attributed to them. <P>What historical evidence can be dug up reveals that they were written much later, not at the time that Jesus
supposedly said all those things, but somewhere around 30 to 50 years later by a person or persons unknown. Furthermore,
when we compare the first four books of the gospel with each other, which supposedly tell more or less the same story, we find
that they contradict each other in so many details that one need only read them for himself to pick them out. I neither have the
time, the space, not the inclination to go into all these contradictions. They are too numerous.
<P><B>Still No Bible at 300 C.E.</B><BR> At this time the Christian movement, although purportedly nearly
300 years old, still did not have a written text or “Bible.” Under the powerful and dictatorial
direction of Emperor Constantine a convocation of church fathers was called at Nicaea, a town in
Asia Minor. At this meeting a number of scripts and writings were dragged together and a
heated controversy ensued over a period of several months. Many writings were considered,
discussed, argued over, and reviewed. Some were revised, some were rewritten, some were
rejected. The final package that emerged from the Council of Nicaea was what was called the
New Testament, a contradictory, demented conglomeration of far-out nonsense. To it was
patched the Jewish “Old Testament.” The Christian movement now had a “Bible,” with
Constantine as final arbiter. When the gathered bishops would or could not agree, he would
threaten to bring in his army, which was standing by outside, to enforce compliance.
Ready to Crush All Opposition. Constantine exercised the full powers of his position,
financially, militarily and in terms of legal enforcement to now promote Christianity and crush
all opposition. Christianity was now on its way.

<P><B>Jews Concocted Christianity.</B><BR> Where did the ideas of Christianity come from? The Jews, who were scattered throughout the Roman Empire, have
been Master Mind-manipulators of other peoples from the earliest beginnings of their history.
They have always been at war with the host peoples they have infested like a parasite. When
during the Jewish Wars of 68-70 C.E., Rome put down the Jewish rebellion in Judea and leveled
Jerusalem to the ground, the Jews were thirsting for revenge. They were looking for a way to
destroy Rome, the Roman race and its total empire. They had tried military opposition and failed
miserably, being no match for the superlative Romans. They looked for an alternative— mind manipulation
through religion— and they found the right creed in a relatively unimportant
religious sect called the Essenes.

<P><B>The Essenes</B><BR> Nevertheless, the evidence is overwhelming that these ideas long preceded the Christian era and it was not Christ who came
out with them but a Jewish sect called the Essenes who lived on the border of the Dead Sea. It was they who had already
evolved the ideas contained in the Sermon on the Mount but have been attributed to Christ. Not only had they evolved the
same ideas as set forth in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, but the wording, the phraseology and the sentences were the same
and they preceded the supposed time of the Sermon on the Mount by anywhere from 50 to 150 years.
The Essenes were a Jewish religious group living in approximately the first century BCE And the first century CE We have
important sources of their contemporary writings in the historian Josephus and also in the philosopher Philo. They are also
mentioned by various other Roman and Greek writers of those times in which their religious teachings are revealed in
considerable detail. However, in the last twenty years the thousands of Dead Sea Scrolls, many of which were written by the
Essenes themselves, reveal a tremendous amount of insight into their religious teachings, and above all, reveal that they
preceded and preempted the Sermon on the Mount word for word, so that the so-called "new" teachings of a figure supposedly
appearing from heaven in the year 1 C.E., and preaching during the years 3- to 33 C.E. were neither original nor were they
new.
Furthermore, we learn that the Essenes were notable for their communistic society, their extreme piety and purity and their
practice of celibacy. They possessed all their worldly goods in common and looked upon private property as an evil which
might divert them from sanctity. They engaged in agriculture and handicrafts, considering these occupations less sinful than
others. They also practiced baptism, and this practice preceded the Christian era by at least one hundred. So the Christian
apostles can hardly be credited with having instituted the ritual of baptism, as is claimed.
<P>
Why, the average reader might ask, haven't we been told more about the Essenes if they were the original practitioners of
Christianity? There are two good and overriding answers for that. The Christians on their part, although the early Christian
fathers were well aware of the Essene teachings and writings, took every measure possible to destroy them and purge them
from circulation. The reason being they did not want their presence known because it would undermine their dogma that Christ
was the originator of the New teaching. It would make impossible the claim that this was a great new revelation sent forth by
God himself amid the hosannas and singing of angels. The Jews, on the other hand, did not want to reveal the presence of the
Essenes because they wish to completely hide any connection between the Jews and the new religious teaching that they
were about to administer unto the Gentiles. They even went to great lengths to appear hostile to it.
Before I go further into the highly illuminating and highly interesting Dead Sea Scrolls I want to make just one further point that
is that the original manuscripts on which the New Testament supposedly based is always alluded to being translated from the
"Original Greek." Since the New Testament repeats over and over again and again that Paul spoke to his flock in Jewish and
that Jesus spoke in Jewish and that the Apostles were Jewish, why, then, is it that the manuscripts were all in Greek?
The historical facts add up to this : the Jewish hierarchy and undoubtedly the whole conspiracy was well coordinated and had
many, many members and co-workers. It was not written at the time of Christ at all, but the movement was given great
promotion by the combined efforts of the Jewish nation. As they organized and promoted their ideas further, these were
reduced to writing considerably later than the years 30 to 33 C.E. when Christ supposedly came out with these startlingly and
"new" revelations. The conclusions are that they were written by Jewish persons whose identity we shall never know and were
written by collectively by many authors, were revised from time to time and not only in their original formation and formulation
but have been revised time and time again throughout the centuries to become more effective and persuasive propaganda.
However, we want to go further into the teachings of the Essenes and who they were and why their particular teachings were
pounced upon by the Jews to be formulated into a well distilled poisonous brew and then fed to the Gentiles.
<P>The Dead Sea Scrolls, which are more numerous and much more revealing than the Jewish press of today has informed us tell
us much about the teachings and the life of the Essenes. One of the important things that they tell us about the Essenes is that
they vanished from the face of the earth after about two centuries of existence and the termination date being somewhere
around the year 100 C.E. They were, needless to say, only a very small sect of the Jewish tribes and not a part of the Jewish
conspiracy as such. Being outside of the mainstream of Jewish activity and thought, the Jews nevertheless observed from
them that this kind of teaching could ruin and destroy a people. The Jews, looking for a way to destroy the Roman nation, who
in the year 70 C.E. had destroyed and leveled Jerusalem to the ground, noted well what these teachings were and decided to
perpetuate them on the Romans.
<P>Essenism was really a revolutionary new form of social order, an ideal cooperative commonwealth in miniature. Instead of the
Messiah, the ideal of the Essenes was the "Teacher of Righteousness." They established a new cooperative communitarian
brotherhood and they were the first religious society to establish and observe the sacraments of baptism and the Eucharistic
meal. Furthermore, the "Teacher of Righteousness" as promulgated by the Essenes may not have been the first pacifist in history,
but he was the first to implement his pacifist theories with an overall practical measure, which if generally adopted, would
abolish war. This, of course, was a wonderful religion for the Jews to sell to the Romans, for if they convert the Romans into
submissive pacifists they could certainly soon thereafter dominate them in full. And this they did.
The Essenes lived in the area of Qumran near the Dead Sea and according to Philo, the Jewish Philosopher and writer
contemporary of that age, "the Essene brotherhood would not allow the manufacture of any weapons or allow within their
community any maker of arrows, spears, swords or any manufacture of engines of war, nor any man occupied with a military
avocation, or even with peaceful practices which might easily be converted to mischief." Not only does Philo tell us about the
Essenes, but also Josephus and Pliny, both contemporary historians, tell us much about the Essenes.
As mentioned before, much is emerging also from the study of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The overriding fact that emerges from the
study of the writings of the historians of that time and the Dead Sea Scrolls is this tremendously significant fact: <BR>Namely that
the beliefs, teachings, and practices attributed to Jesus Christ,although not exactly identical in all respects with those of the
Essene school, were nevertheless, closer to those of the Essenes than to those of the Bishops of the Ecumenical Council
which determined the Nicene Creed of orthodox Christianity.
<P>So we can come to the obvious conclusion that the Christian beliefs and doctrines as supposedly enunciated by Christ in the
Sermon on the Mount did not originate at all at that time but at least 100 years earlier from a Jewish sect called the Essenes
living near the Dead Sea; that the Elders of Sanhedrin recognized this teaching as being deadly and suicidal; that they further
took this doctrine and distilled and refined it into a working creed; the Jews then, with a great deal of energy and tremendous
amounts of propaganda (in which they excel), promoted and distributed this poisonous doctrine among the Romans.
Setting this creed down in writing in what is now called the New Testament evolved over the next several centuries. It was
written by persons unknown to us today but undoubtedly of Jewish origin. Furthermore, to give it a mystical and heavenly sent
deification, they invented the person of Jesus Christ, and claimed that he was the "Son of God". Then, having laid the ground
work for this new church, they consolidated that power at a meeting in Nicene, where the creation of the new church was
solidified, the creed formalized and given official sanctification.
Thus, in short, was launched the new church and the new religion of "Jesus Christ" which was fabricated out of thin air. Not a
single trace of the Jesus Christ personage can be found in authentic history. Nevertheless, this newly fabricated hoax of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God this idea, with all its suicidal doctrines, was soon to pull down in ruins the great Roman Empire and the
great White civilization that went with it.
Never again did the White Race shake off the control if the Jews. Never again did the White Man regain control of his own
thinking, of his own religion, his own finances, nor his own government. Unto this day the White Race has not regained control
of its own destiny.






<P><B>Death of the Romans.</B><BR> We all know what happened to the Romans shortly after they were
“converted” to Christianity. With their instincts deadened and their thinking perverted into
worrying about the spooks in the sky instead of struggling for their own survival and
advancement, they soon shrank into oblivion. They faded from the scene of history. They paid
the penalty of allowing themselves to be mongrelized and not recognizing their eternal enemy,
the Jew.
<BR>Such are the consequences of not recognizing your enemy, and, of course, you can’t defend
yourself against an enemy you can’t, or won’t, recognize.


<P>The Jewish-Christian bible is a mass of contradictions that has
something to say positively and negatively on all sides of every issue. It is like a musical
instrument— you can play on it any tune you choose. By picking out those particular passages
that suit your argument and ignoring all other passages that contradict it, you can have God and
the bible on your side to back up your argument, any argument, whatever it may be.
As the Jews have often pointed out, they always first
enlist the aid of the stupid preachers to help spread their corrosive ideas. The passages that were
now emphasized were that “we are all God’s children”, that “we are all equal in the eyes of the
Lord”, that “we all have a soul”, that Jesus came to “save all sinners”, and a lot of similar drivel.

<P><I>[The Jews are masters of argument. They capitalize in teaching argument tactics to their young in their Yeshivas (Jewish religious schools.]</I>



<P><B>Infiltration of the Jews.</B><BR> At about this time Rome itself was infiltrated by an alien people
that were to prove more deadly, more treacherous and more tenacious than the Carthaginians.
According to a Jewish Encyclopedia, the first accounts of Jewish settlement in Rome date to 139
B.C.E., but they undoubtedly were there much earlier. It states that Rome is the oldest continuous
Jewish settlement in the world. Unlike the Carthaginians, the Jews were not a military threat, but
more like an internal disease or virus, they undermined and sickened the whole body politic,
culturally, economically, religiously, morally and racially.
<P>
Jews had Racial Religion. The answer to the question is this: the Jews then, as now,
possessed a strong racial religion, and they have rallied around their religion with race as the
core, for the last five thousand years. We have already studied the importance of a racial
religion in the previous chapter and will have more to say about this in subsequent chapters.
In their rebellion against the Romans, the Jews were utterly devastated militarily. They
realized that they could never match the Romans in a contest of arms.
<P>
Dispersion. But they had a number of other factors going for them. Unlike Carthage they
were not congregated in a specific geographic area. In fact, they were dispersed all over the
Roman world, specializing even then in the slave trade, in finance, and feeding on the trade
routes. Then as now, they covered all the nerve centers of power. The dispersion out of
Jerusalem and Judea did not weaken but only reinforced the Jewish infection on the lifelines of
the Roman Empire.
<P><B>Planned Revenge.</B><BR> Collectively they planned revenge on the Romans, for whom they
harbored an intense and pathological hatred. In fact, the Jews always hate that which is best in
the Aryan Race and instinctively set about to destroy the best.
<BR>Since the Jews knew they had no chance of destroying the Romans militarily, they conspired
to use their most powerful weapon— mind manipulation, and they chose religion as the vehicle
to do it with.
<P><B>The Christian Churches.</B><BR> Every creed and tenet that Christianity has espoused for the last
17 centuries has influenced our thinking towards down-breeding of our race. Christianity
continuously and perpetually agitates against the fit and the competent and directs our interest
and sympathy towards helping the halt, the lame, the blind, the poor in spirit, the morons and the
idiots, by such teachings as “Blessed are the poor in spirit” (morons); “Blessed are the meek, for
they shall inherit the earth.”  The very
idea that we are all equal in the eyes of an imaginary spook is just another re-hash of the old
Jewish equalitarian hoax all over again and must inevitably lead to race-mixing.

<P>The White Man’s Innate Tendency towards Compassion is the Achilles heel that has been
his own worst enemy ever since Jewish Christianity conquered and destroyed the Romans.
Whereas every other species in Nature instinctively rejects and culls out the misfits, the White
Race stupidly does just the opposite.
<P>Ancient Greeks Practiced Eugenics. The idea of eugenics is not new. The Spartans of
ancient Greece back in the fifth century B.C.E. were already aware of it and practiced much of
what we are proposing today.
<P><B>Jews Supreme Racists.</B><BR> Whereas all this race-mixing propaganda is aimed at the [Gentiles], the Jews push a completely opposite line to their own people. The Jews being
yellow Semites, being racially aware and fanatically loyal to their own, preach racial aloofness to
their own people. Through their synagogues, through their own Jewish press, through the
thousands of exclusively Jewish organizations they warn strongly against inter-racial marriages,
against inter-faith marriages. No Race-Mixing for Jews. In short, the Jew, while viciously promoting the bastardization
of the White Race, fervidly guards his own against it. In Israel anyone not born of a Jewish
mother is a goy, a non-Jew, an outsider, and can’t be married or buried in Israel, nor can they
become a citizen or enjoy any of the other civil rights of a born Jew. Racial solidarity is the
order of the day, whether a Jew lives in Israel or anywhere else in the world.

<P>The Jew carries the alien reptilian gene through the mother which is recessive. The gargoyle like features of Jewish celebrities Rodney Dangerfield, Larry King, Bela Abzug, Don Rickles and many others are obvious. To be accepted among orthodox (knowing jews), one must have a jewish mother. The Genes do not match up and the Jewish people are plagued by a host of rare diseases such as "Tay Sachs," Berger's Disease, multiple sclerosis, and many others. The Jews themselves even admit there is a common gene they can all be traced to. <a href="https://www.aish.com/societywork/sciencenature/the_cohanim_-_dna_connection.asp">LINK</a>

<P><B>Mind police.</B><BR> Since the Jews for the last several thousand years have been carrying on the
most vicious conspiracy in history, namely the destruction and take-over of all other peoples—
they have been fanatic to the point of being paranoid about spying and gathering information on
their enemies. And this is understandable. Since the hideous crime they are perpetrating is all
based on secrecy and deceit, holding the lid on their conspiracy is a highly precarious business.
So they frantically enter into all kinds of devices, spy organizations and means of gathering
intelligence that would stagger the limits of the Gentile mind. The Jews not only want to know
what their enemies (everybody is their enemy) are doing, they also want to know what they
might be planning. In fact, as far as is possible they want to know what everybody is thinking
before such thinking might be translated into action.
<P><B>The A.D.L.</B><BR> The A.D.L., short for Anti-Defamation League, is in America. Ostensibly, it
pretends to safeguard Jewish interests and prevent the spread of “anti-Semitism.” Why the Jews
should find this necessary when the English, the Germans, the Italians or other ethnic groups find
such safeguards unnecessary, they have never explained. But in reality the A.D.L. is much,
much more than that. Presumably an offshoot of the Jewish B’nai B’rith, it is really the main
powerhouse of this Jewish outfit. In reality it is a powerful, well financed spy operation inside
our own borders that not only gathers information on politicians, civic organizations, diverse
individuals, but on anything and everything that they so much as even suspect might blow the lid
on the Jewish conspiracy. They have huge files and electronic computers that rival the F.B.I. and
the C.I.A. itself, and any information the F.B.I. or C.I.A. might have that is considered useful to
the A.D.L. is readily fed to the latter.
<P><B>Censorship Operation.</B><BR> The A.D.L.’s activities extend much further. They are extremely
active in politics— promoting those useful to the Jews and destroying those that might be
deemed uncooperative. They also monitor all books, magazines, newspapers, all news media,
movements or whatever— anything that might effect the Jewish conspiracy— and this includes
just about everything of any significance that happens in this country.
Plant Propaganda. They aggressively invent, if necessary, news stories and plant them into
the mainstream of the news media— T.V., newspapers, etc. They not only publish a great
number of articles for dissemination, but they also publish a large number of books that are
either favorable to Israel and the Jews or viciously attack their enemies.
