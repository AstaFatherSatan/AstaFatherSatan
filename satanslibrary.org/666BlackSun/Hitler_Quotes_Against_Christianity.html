<P>"Leave the hair-splitting to others. Whether it's the Old Testament or the New, or simply the sayings of Jesus, it's all the same old Jewish swindle. It will not make us free. A German church, a German Christianity is a distortion. One is either a German or a Christian. You cannot be both." 

<P>"Hitler made it clear that he was not interested in an "Aryanized Christianity" or the "Aryan Jesus" myth promoted by Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Von Liebenfels, and certain party members. "You cannot make an Aryan out of Jesus, that's nonsense. What needs to be done you say? I will tell you: we must prevent the churches from doing anything but, what they are doing now, that is, losing ground day by day. But we can hasten matters. The parsons will be made to dig their own graves." he stated."

<P>"Fundamentally in everyone there is the feeling for this allmighty,
which we call God (that is to say, the dominion of
natural laws throughout the whole universe). The priests, who
have always succeeded in exploiting this feeling, threaten
punishments for the man who refuses to accept the creed they
impose."

<P>
"Bolshevism, the illegitimate child of Christianity."
<P>
"The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming
of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity's illegitimate child.
Both are inventions of the Jew. The deliberate lie in the matter
of religion was introduced into the world by Christianity.
Bolshevism practices a lie of the same nature, when it claims to
bring liberty to men, whereas in reality it seeks only to enslave
them. In the ancient world, the relations between men and
gods were founded on an instinctive respect. It was a world enlightened
by the idea of tolerance. Christianity was the first
creed in the world to exterminate its adversaries in the name of
love. Its key-note is intolerance."
<P>
"Without Christianity, we should not have had Islam. The
Roman Empire, under Germanic influence, would have
developed in the direction of world-domination, and humanity
would not have extinguished fifteen centuries of civilization at a
single stroke."
<P>"Let it not be said that Christianity brought man the life of
the soul, for that evolution was in the natural order of things.
The result of the collapse of the Roman Empire was a night
that lasted for centuries."
<P>
"Christianity is a rebellion against natural law, a protest
against nature. Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity
would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure."
<P>
"Science cannot lie, for it's
always striving, according to the momentary state of knowledge,
to deduce what is true. When it makes a mistake, it does
so in good faith. It's Christianity that's the liar. It's in perpetual
conflict with itself."
<P>
"The reason why the ancient world was so pure, light and
serene was that it knew nothing of the two great scourges : the
pox and Christianity."
<P>"Christianity is a prototype of Bolshevism: the mobilization by
the Jew of the masses of slaves with the object of undermining
society. Thus one understands that the healthy elements of the
Roman world were proof against this doctrine."
<P>
"Of old, it was
in the name of Christianity. Today, it's in the name of
Bolshevism.
Yesterday, the instigator was Saul: the instigator to-day,
Mardochai.
Saul has changed into St. Paul, and Mardochai into Karl Marx.
By exterminating this pest, we shall do humanity a service of
which our soldiers can have no idea."
<P>"After all, it was only
between the sixth and eighth centuries that Christianity was
imposed on our peoples by princes who had an alliance of
interests with the shavelings. Our peoples had previously succeeded
in living all right without this religion. I have six
divisions of SS composed of men absolutely indifferent in
matters of religion. It doesn't prevent them from going to their
deaths with serenity in their souls."
<P>
"But Christianity is an invention of sick brains: one
could imagine nothing more senseless, nor any more indecent
way of turning the idea of the Godhead into a mockery."
<P>
"Pure Christianity—the Christianity of the catacombs—is
concerned with translating the Christian doctrine into facts. It
leads quite simply to the annihilation of mankind. It is merely
whole-hearted Bolshevism, under a tinsel of metaphysics."
<P>
"It was Christianity that brought about the fall
of Rome—not the Germans or the Huns.
What Bolshevism is achieving to-day on the materialist and
technical level, Christianity had achieved on the metaphysical
level."
<P>
"One cannot succeed in conceiving how much cruelty, ignominy
and falsehood the intrusion of Christianity has spelt for this
world of ours."
<P>
"It is Jewry that always destroys this order. It constantly provokes
the revolt of the weak against the strong, of bestiality
against intelligence, of quantity against quality. It took fourteen
centuries for Christianity to reach the peak of savagery and
stupidity. We would therefore be wrong to sin by excess of
confidence and proclaim our definite victory over Bolshevism.
The more we render the Jew incapable of harming us, the more
we shall protect ourselves from this danger. The Jew plays in
nature the role of a catalyzing element. A people that is rid of
its Jews returns spontaneously to the natural order."
<P>
"Christianity
is the worst of the regressions that mankind can ever have
undergone, and it's the Jew who, thanks to this diabolic invention,
has thrown him back fifteen centuries. The only thing
that would be still worse would be victory for the Jew through
Bolshevism. If Bolshevism triumphed, mankind would lose the
gift of laughter and joy. It would become merely a shapeless
mass, doomed to grayness and despair."
<P>
"The priests of antiquity were closer to nature, and they sought
modestly for the meaning of things. Instead of that, Christianity
promulgates its inconsistent dogmas and imposes them by
force. Such a religion carries within it intolerance and persecution.
It's the bloodiest conceivable."
<P>
"The same thing is happening to music as is happening to beauty
in a world dominated by the shavelings—the Christian religion
is an enemy to beauty."
<P>
"I shall never come personally to terms with the
Christian lie."
<P>
Our epoch will certainly see the end of the disease of Christianity.
<P>
"This terrorism in religion is the product,
to put it briefly, of a Jewish dogma, which Christianity
has universalized and whose effect is to sow trouble and confusion
in men's minds. It's obvious that, in the realm of belief, terrorist teachings have no other object but to distract men from
their natural optimism and to develop in them the instinct of
cowardice."<P>
"As far as we are concerned, we've succeeded in chasing the
Jews from our midst and excluding Christianity from our
political life.<BR>
If nowadays we do not find the same splendid pride
of race which distinguished the Grecian and Roman eras, it is
because in the fourth century these Jewish-Christians systematically
destroyed all the monuments of these ancient
civilizations. It was they, too, who destroyed the library at
Alexandria."
<P>
"The religion fabricated by Paul of Tarsus, which was later
called Christianity, is nothing but the Communism of today."
<BR>Bormann intervened. "Jewish methods, he said, have never varied
in their essentials. Everywhere they have stirred up the plebs against the
ruling classes. Everywhere they have fostered discontent against the
established power. For these are the seeds which produce the crop they
hope later to gather. Everywhere they fan the flames of hatred between
peoples of the same blood. It is they who invented class-warfare, and the
repudiation of this theory must therefore always be an anti-Jewish
measure. In the same way, any doctrine which is anti-Communist, any
doctrine which is anti-Christian must, ipso facto, be anti-Jewish as well.
The National Socialist doctrine is therefore anti-Jewish in excelsis,
for it is both anti-Communist and anti-Christian. National Socialism
is solid to the core, and the whole of its strength is concentrated against the
Jews, even in matters which appear to have a purely social aspect and are
designed for the furtherance of the social amenities of our own people."

<P>The Fuehrer concluded:
<BR>"Burgdorff has just given me a paper which deals with the relationship
between Communism and Christianity. It is comforting
to see how, even in these days, the fatal relationship
between the two is daily becoming clearer to the human
intelligence."
