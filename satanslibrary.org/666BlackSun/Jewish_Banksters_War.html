This is the first part of a two-part article. The second part deals with the communizing wing and is found here:

<P>
"The establishment of a central bank is 90% of communizing a nation." —Lenin
<P>
"Let me issue and control a Nation's money and I care not for who writes its laws." —Mayer Amschel Rothschild, 1790 
<P>
"The Rothschilds introduced the rule of money into European politics. The Rothschilds were the servants of money who undertook the reconstruction of the world as an image of money and its functions. Money and the employment of wealth have become the law of European life; we no longer have nations, but economic provinces." 
[New York Times, Professor Wilhelm, a German historian, July 8, 1937]. 
<P>
"If you will look back at every war in Europe during the nineteenth century, you will see that they always ended with the establishment of a 'balance of power.' With every re-shuffling there was a balance of power in a new grouping around the House of Rothschild in England, France, or Austria. They grouped nations so that if any king got out of line, a war would break out and the war would be decided by which way the financing went. Researching the debt positions of the warring nations will usually indicate who was to be punished."  —Economist Stuart Crane. 
<P>
"They [the Jews] work more effectively against us than the enemy's armies. They are a hundred times more dangerous to our liberties and the great cause we are engaged in. It is much to be lamented that each state, long ago, has not hunted them down as pests to society and the greatest enemies we have to the happiness of America."
<BR>Source: Maxims of George Washington by A. A. Appleton & Co.
<P>
"I fully agree with General Washington, that we must protect this young nation from an insidious influence and impenetration. That menace, gentlemen, is the Jews. In whatever country Jews have settled in any great number, they have lowered its moral tone; depreciated its commercial integrity; have segregated themselves and have not been assimilated; have built up a state within a state;
and when opposed have tried to strangle that country to death financially, as in the case of Spain and Portugal.
<P>
"For over 1700 hundred years, the Jews have been bewailing their sad fate in that they have been exiled from their homeland, as they call Palestine. But, gentlemen, did the world give it to them in fee simple, they would at once find some reason for not returning. Why? Because they are vampires, and vampires do not live on vampires. They cannot live only amongst themselves. They must subsist on other people not of their race. If you do not exclude them from these United States in the Constitution, in less than 200 years they will have swarmed here in such great numbers that they will dominate and devour the land, and change our form of government, for which we Americans have shed our blood, given our lives, our substance, and jeopardized our liberty."
<P>
"If you do not exclude them, in less than 200 years our descendants will be working in the fields to furnish them substance, while they will be in the counting houses rubbing their hands. I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude the Jews for all time, your children will curse you in your graves."
<BR>—Benjamin Franklin, at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia. 
<P>
[Note, the Jews have been forever whining that these quotes are false, because they know in fact they are true, and are thus a great and damning condemnation of their crimes] 
<P>
"When, on the Day of Atonement, you walk into a synagogue, the very first prayer that you recite, you stand — and it's the only prayer for which you stand — and you repeat three times a short prayer. The Kol Nidre. In that prayer, you enter into an agreement with God Almighty that any oath, vow, or pledge that you may make during the next twelve months — any oath, vow or pledge that you may take during the next twelve months shall be null and void. 
<BR>The oath shall not be an oath; the vow shall not be a vow; the pledge shall not be a pledge. They shall have no force and effect, and so forth and so on. 
And further than that, the Talmud teaches: "Don't forget — whenever you take an oath, vow, and pledge — remember the Kol Nidre prayer that you recited on the Day of Atonement, and that exempts you from fulfilling that". —Benjamin Freedman 
<P>
The Kol Nidre prayer:
<BR>Thereupon the cantor chants the Aramaic prayer beginning with the words "Kol Nidre," and, gradually increasing in volume from pianissimo to fortissimo, repeats three times the following words: 
"All vows, obligations, oaths, and anathemas, which we may vow, or swear, or pledge, or whereby we may be bound, from this Day of Atonement until the next [whose happy coming we await], we do repent. May they be deemed absolved, forgiven, annulled, and void, and made of no effect; they shall not bind us nor have power over us. The vows shall not be reckoned vows; the obligations shall not be obligatory; nor the oaths be oaths." 
<P>
Sounds like a people you can trust to tell you the truth? 
<P>
The silent war against America began in 1791 when the Rothschild agent and Jew, Alexander Hamilton in George Washington's cabinet was able to establish the legal base for a central bank in America to be born- the "First Bank of the United States." With a 20-year charter in 1811, the charter for Rothschild's "First Bank of the United States" runs out and Congress voted against its renewal. In response to this, Nathan Mayer Rothschild threatened the America government with the direct statement "Either the application for renewal of the charter is granted or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war." 
<P>
The American government refused to bow to the threat and the vote remained. 
<P>
Nathan Rothschild upon hearing the news made the statement "Teach those impudent Americans a lesson; bring them back to colonial status!" Therefore, Britain by this time being firmly under the control of Rothschilds and other Jewish banking families declared war on America. The war of 1812 began, lasting several years and killing thousands, leaving the American capital burned to the ground. The aim of this war for the Jews was to cause the Free Gentile Nation of America to create such a massive war debt in defending themselves, that they would be forced to cede, and renew the charter. 
<BR>The plan succeeded in 1816. The American government was forced by terrorist tactics of the Jews to create a new 20-year charter for the Rothschilds "Second Bank of America." 
<P>
In 1832, things began to change. Andrew Jackson ran for the second campaign for office on the promise: "Jackson and no Bank!" Jackson angry at the criminal nature of the Rothschilds' banking tactics desired to end their mafia like control on America's money system and put it back into the trust of the American people. Jackson did this by removing all government deposits from the "Second Bank of American" and depositing them into the Gentile owned American Banks. 
<P>
The Rothschilds then sent their agents out to contract the money supply, inciting a depression to hit the Nation, as way to pressure the government. Jackson openly declared them as the crooks they are and vowed to route them out. Not long after, on January 30 1835, there was an assassination attempt on President Jackson. He was saved by the fact the assassins' pistols both misfired. Later Jackson stated that he knew the Rothschilds where responsible for the attempt. Jackson was not intimidated by the Jewish Banking mafia. He continued his long fight against the Rothschild's bank and in 1836 he won and had their bank cast out of the Nation when their charter is not renewed. 
<P>
"I am one of those who do not believe the national debt is a national blessing, but rather a curse to a republic, inasmuch as it is calculated to raise around the administration a moneyed aristocracy dangerous to the liberties of the country." —Andrew Jackson, Letter to L. H. Coleman of Warrenton, N.C., 29 April 1824 
<P>
Later in 1841, President Tyler vetoed the act to renew the charter for Rothschild's bank. In response, he was threatened with assassination from many "anonymous" sources. 
The Jews instigated the Civil War in America. President Lincoln appealed to large New York based banks for loans for the war [Rothschild and the Jewish Banking mafia, being behind many of and having control over those banks] the criminal deal they make him is 24% to 36% on all monies loaned. This was another tactic used to regain control over the American people through debt. Lincoln angry and aware simply printed his own debt free money instead, outwitting the Jews. Lincoln stated this fact, "We gave the people of this republic the greatest blessing they ever had, their own paper money to pay their own debts." 
<P>
In 1863, Lincoln discovered the Tsar of Russia, Alexander the II, was having identical problems with the Jewish banks, mainly the Rothschilds, and was also resisting their attempts to create a Central bank in Russia. The Tsar then came to the aid of Lincoln by ordering that if England and/or France [both under the domination of Rothschild/Jewish banking families] actively came to the aid of the South, he would consider this an act of open war, and take up arms on the side of President Lincoln. The Tsar then ordered a major part of his Pacific fleet to San Francisco and New York. 
<P>
In 1865, President Lincoln stated, "I have two great enemies; the Southern Army in front of me, and the financial institutions in the rear. Of the two, the one in the rear is my greatest foe." That same year on April 14, Lincoln was assassinated by Jew John Wilkes Booth.
"John Booth was a Jewish silversmith whose ancestors had been exiled from Portugal because of their radical political views. In London, the refugees had continued their trade and convictions, and John married Wilkes' cousin. This Wilkes was the 'celebrated agitator' John Wilkes of Westminster, London. John Wilkes Booth's father was Junius Brutus Booth." [The Mad Booths of Maryland]
<P>
In the book, "The Secret World Government or the Hidden Hand," Major General Count Cherep Spiridovich revealed how the Jewish bankers incited the Civil War, and why they opposed Lincoln:
<P>
"ROTHSCHILDS' ORDER TO AMERICAN BANKERS."
<BR>"To pay the soldiers the Government issued its Treasury notes, authorized by act of Congress, July 17, 1861, "for $50,000,000, bearing no interest. These notes circulated at par with gold. The Rothschilds' agents inspired the American banks to offer to Lincoln a loan of $150 million. But before they had taken much of the loan, the banks broke down and suspended specie payments in Dec. 1861. They wished to blackmail Lincoln and demanded the "shaving" of government paper to the extent of 33%, an extortion which was refused. A bill drafted for the Government issue of $150 million^ which should be full legal tender for every debt in the United States, passed the House of Representatives Feb. 25, 1862, and was hailed with delight by the entire country.' But the Wall Street bankers were furious."
<P>
Sen. Pettigrew reprints the so called "Hazzard Circular" sent in 1862 by the Bank of England [ruled by the Rothschilds]: 
<BR>"Slavery is likely to be abolished by the war power and chattel slavery destroyed. This I [Rothschild] and my European friends (the 300 men) are glad of, for slavery is but the owning of labor and carries with it the care of the laborer, while the European [read 'Rothschildian'] plan led on by England [i.e. the Rothschilds] is for capital to control labor by controlling wages. THIS CAN BE DONE BY. CONTROLLING THE MONEY. THE GREAT DEBT THAT CAPITALISTS "WILL SEE TO IS MADE OUT OF THE "WAR must be used as a means to control the volume of money. To accomplish this the BONDS must be used as a banking basis. "We are now waiting for the Secretary of the Treasury to make his recommendation to Congress. It will not do to ALLOW the GREENBACK, as it is called, to circulate as money any length of time, as we cannot control that."
<P>
Thus the order of the Rothschilds was clear: "Capitalists "WILL SEE TO IT that a DEBT is MADE out of the war." 
<P>
The result was that by "hook and crook" the Rothschilds enslaved this country. And Schiffs,, Baruchs & Co. are the rulers. The Chairman of the Committee on "Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, Mr Thaddeus Stevens explains how the United States was captured by the Rothschilds: 
<P>
"The agents of the banks fell upon the bill in haste and disfigured it." 
In the Senate, this amendment was tacked upon the bill: 
"Good for all debts and dues of the U. S. EXCEPT DUTIES ON IMPORTS AND INTEREST on the PUBLIC DEBT," ($150 million above mentioned, plus $70 million, a pre-war debt). Thus equipped this bill went forth to rob every American and turn the ownership of this nation into the hands of capitalists." (Mrs. Hobart). 
<P>
"When the bill came back to the House, Mr. Stevens said: "We are about to consummate a cunningly devised scheme which will bring GREAT LOSS to all classes of people, except one" (the Rothschilds' branch of the Wall Street). The bill was passed. 
 <P>
ROTHSCHILDS OVERPOWERED CONGRESS (1862)
<BR>The Rothschilds were in possession of 80% of the gold in the country. They had a "corner" on gold. By securing this discrimination against the "greenback" by means of the "Exception clause," they made a market for their gold. 
<P>
"Importers were obliged to go to Wall Street to buy gold to pay duties on their goods, and the Wall Street gamblers held the power to fix the price. Gold went to a premium. Had the greenbacks been permitted to retain their full legal-tender quality, there would have been no need for gold to pay import duties. The price of gold rapidly rose and before the war closed, had reached the price of $2.85, measured in greenbacks. The gold bought in Wall Street to pay import duties became the revenues of the government and was by it paid back to Wall Street as interest on the public debt. As fast as the bankers sold the gold, it was returned for interest on the public debt to be sold again. Thus during the entire war these gold gamblers speculated in gold, making fortunes from the blood and tears of the American people," (Mrs. M. E. Hobart in her "The Secret of Rothschilds, " p. 54).
<P>
Two more issues of $150 million each, with the "Exception clause" were authorized in July 1862 and in March 1863, making in all $450,000,000. They bore no interest. When these issues were exhausted and necessity arose for additional money the bankers demanded that Treasury Notes should no longer be made in the form of DOLLARS, but in the form of BONDS: the bond draws interest, the dollar does not. 
<P>
A gigantic war costing seven billions was carried through without gold. Why? Because everything was supplied at home, and American money, the "greenbacks" were gladly accepted. "How then was it that this government, several years after the war was over, found itself owing in London and Wall Street several hundred million dollars to men who never fought a battle, who never made a uniform, never furnished a pound of bread, men, who never did an honest day's work in all their lives... The fact is, that billions owned by the sweat, tears and blood of American laborers have been poured into the coffers of these men for absolutely nothing. This 'sacred war debt' was only a gigantic scheme of fraud, concocted by European capitalists and enacted into American law by the aid of American congressmen, who were their paid hirelings or their ignorant dupes. That this crime has remained uncovered is due to the power of prejudice, which seldom permits the victim to see clearly or reason correctly: 'the Money power prolongs its reign by working on the prejudices' (Lincoln). Every means has been employed to deceive the masses. Ridicule and derision have been applied to all opposition, while flattery and appreciation were showered upon the officials," (Mary E. Hobart, p. 49).
<P>
Bismarck knew the truth and revealed it in 1876 to a German, Conrad Siem, who published it in ['La Vieille France,' N-216, March 1921]. Bismarck said:
<BR>'The division of the United States into two federations of equal force was decided long before the Civil War by the High Financial Powers of Europe. These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained as one nation, would attain economical and financial independence, which would upset their financial domination of the World. The voice of the Rothschilds predominated. They foresaw tremendous booty if they could substitute two feeble democracies, indebted to the Jewish financiers, to the vigorous Republic, confident and self-providing. Therefore, they incited their emissaries in exploiting the issue of slavery, thus digging an abyss between the two sides of the Republic. Lincoln never suspected these underground machinations. He was anti-slavery, and he was elected as such, but his character prevented him from being a man of one party. 
<P>
When he had affairs in his hands, he perceived that these sinister financiers of Europe, the Rothschilds, wished to make him the executor of their designs. They made the fracture between the North and the South imminent! The masters of Finance in Europe made this rift definitive in order to exploit it to the utmost. Lincoln's personality surprised them. His candidature did not trouble them: they thought they could easily deceive the candidate woodcutter. However, Lincoln read their plots and soon understood that the South was not the worst foe, but the Jew financiers were. He did not confide his apprehensions; he watched the gestures of the hidden hand. He did not wish to expose publicly the questions that would disconcert the ignorant masses. He decided to eliminate the International bankers, by establishing a system of Loans, thus allowing the States to borrow directly from the people without an intermediary. He did not study financial questions, but his robust good sense revealed to him, that the source of any wealth resides in the work and the economy of the nation. He opposed emissions through the International financiers. He obtained from Congress the right to borrow from the people by selling to it the 'bonds' of States. The local banks were only too glad to help such a system, and the Government and the nation escaped the plots of the foreign financiers. They understood at once, that the United Stats could escape their grip. The death of Lincoln was resolved upon. Nothing is easier than to find a fanatic to strike.' 
'The death of Lincoln was a disaster. There was no man in the United States great enough to wear his boots, and Jewish bankers went anew to grab the riches of the World. I fear that Jewish Banks with their craftiness and tortuous tricks will entirely control the exuberant riches of America, and use these to systematically corrupt modern civilization. The Jew will not hesitate to plunge the entire world into wars and chaos, in order that 'the earth should become the inheritance of Israel.''
<P>
Thus Bismarck, who knew the game of the Jews, spoke in 1876, 
[According to Bismarck (La Vieille France, N-216) it was Disraeli and his patrons, the Rothschilds, who invented the plan of destroying the United States by fomenting a Civil War here, and by a foreign attack in 1863-64 by five powers. Abraham Lincoln, the national hero of the United States, was murdered by the same Hidden Hand, which killed six Romanov Czars, ten Kings, and scores of Ministers only to make it easier to bleed their nations]
 Lincoln was re-inaugurated on March 4, 1865 and was shot on April 4, 1865 by actor Wilkes Booth, who cried, 'The South is revenged.' He was a Jew, but this has never been mentioned!"

<P>
President Garfield stated in 1881, two weeks before he was also assassinated by Jew Charles J. Guiteau:  "Whosoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.... And when you realize the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate."
<P>
The next two Presidents to be murdered were also murdered by the Jews. William McKinley, the third American President to be assassinated, was murdered by a Jew named Leon Czolgosz. President Kennedy was also murdered by Jewry for the same reasons Congressman McFadden was, and President Jackson had two attempts upon his life.
<P>
Then in 1913, the Federal Reserve central bank was established in America, under orders of Jewish puppet President Woodrow Wilson. This act literally handed the America economy over to a handful of powerful Jewish banking families, bringing about what President Garfield warned would happen. 
The main Jewish names behind creating this system of control were: 

<P><UL><LI>The Rothschilds 
	<LI>The Rockefellers 
	<LI>The Morgans 
	<LI>The Warburgs 
</UL>
<P>
The placement for this was carried out by Morgan who used his position to publish lies that a powerful bank in New York was bankrupt, knowing it would cause mass panic and a chain reaction among the Gentile public causing them to withdraw their monies, and causing the banks to call in all loans, which forced the recipients of the loans to sell whatever they had from properties on. Thus, a depression was generated by the Jews. 
<P>
"Early in 1907, New York Times Annual Financial Review published Paul Warburg's (a partner of Kuhn, Loeb and Co.) first official reform plan, entitled "A Plan for a Modified Central Bank," in which he outlined remedies that he thought might avert panics. Early in 1907, Jacob Schiff, the chief executive officer of Kuhn, Loeb and Co., in a speech to the New York Chamber of Commerce, warned that "unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit resources, this country is going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history." "The Panic of 1907" hit full stride in October. [Herrick]
<BR> The Panic of 1907 and Some of Its Lessons," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, vol. 31 [Jan.-June 1908] 
<P>
"The Morgan interests took advantage to precipitate the panic of 1907, guiding it shrewdly as it progressed." --Fredrick Allen, Life Magazine 
<P>
The Panic led to a Congressional investigation, headed by Senator Nelson Aldrich and the Commission led by Aldrich recommended a Central Bank should be implemented so a panic like 1907 could never happen again. Note Aldrich later married into the Rockefeller family. 
<P>
In 1910, a secret meeting was held at a J.P. Morgan estate on Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia. It was there that the central banking bill called the Federal Reserve Act was written. This legislation was written by Jewish bankers, not lawmakers. After this bill was constructed, it was then handed over to their political front man, Senator Nelson Aldrich, to push through Congress. 
<P>
"Aldrich's investigation led to his plan in 1912 to bring central banking to the United States, with promises of financial stability, expanded international roles, control by impartial experts, and no political meddling in finance. Aldrich asserted that a central bank had to be, paradoxically, decentralized somehow, or it would be attacked by local politicians and bankers, as had the First and Second Banks of the United States. The Aldrich plan was introduced in 62nd and 63rd Congresses (1912 and 1913) but never gained much traction as the Democrats in 1912, won control of both the House and the Senate as well as the White House."
<P>
In 1913, Woodrow Wilson, put up and backed by the Jewish bankers, was elected President upon the promise that in return for their financial support he would sign the Federal Reserve Act into law. At the time, the act was thwarted in Congress from passing. The Jews moved, two days before Christmas when most of the Congressmen were at home with their families, the Federal Reserve Act was voted in, and Wilson true to his treasonous word, in turn made it law.
<P>
"The Aldrich Plan is the Wall Street Plan. It is a broad challenge to the Government by the champion of the Money Trust. It means another panic, if necessary, to intimidate the people. Aldrich, paid by the Government to represent the people, proposes a plan for the trusts instead. The Aldrich Plan was a forerunner to that which spawned the Federal Reserve." --Congressman Lindbergh 
<P>
“When the Federal Reserve Act was passed, the people of these United States did not perceive that a world banking system was being set up here. A super-state controlled by [Jewish] international bankers and industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure. Every effort has been made by the Fed to conceal its powers but the truth is—the Fed has usurped the government.” (Congressman Louis McFadden, upon the passage of the Federal Reserve bill. The Unseen Hand, p. 182.)
<P>
"This Act establishes the most gigantic trust on Earth. When the President signs this bill, the invisible government by the Monetary Power will be legalized, the people may not know it immediately but the day of reckoning is only a few years removed.... The worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking bill." <BR>—Congressman Lindbergh 
<P>
"The Federal Reserve System virtually controls the nation's monetary system, yet it is accountable to no one. It has no budget; it is subject to no audit; and no Congressional Committee knows of, or can truly supervise, its operations." 
<BR>— Professor Murray N. Rothbard, economist, and academic advisor of the Ludwig von Mises Institute.
<P>
President Wilson also brought America into the First World War for the Jews, after being elected on the promise of keeping America out of the war. 
<P>
Another important reason the Jews wanted America involved in World War I, was now that the Jews were in control of the American money supply via the Fed Reserve, America's entry into the war would require the American government to take out massive war loans, indebting the nation to the Jewish banks much faster and at a substantial pace. 
<P>
Benjamin Freedman, the Jewish defector who was later murdered by the Mossad, stated:
"At the outbreak of World War I, the Federal Reserve was better positioned than the Treasury to issue war bonds, and so became the primary retailer for war bonds under the direction of the Treasury. After the war, the Federal Reserve, led by Paul Warburg and New York Governor Bank President Benjamin Strong, convinced Congress to modify its powers, giving it the ability to both create money, as the 1913 Act intended, and destroy money, as a central bank could." 
<P>
Mr. Freedman, born in 1890, was a successful Jewish businessman of New York City who was at one time the principal owner of the Woodbury Soap Company. He broke with organized Jewry after the Judeo-Communist victory of 1945.
<P>
Exerpt 1:
"In 1916 in London the Zionists made a deal with the British War Cabinet to send your sons to war in Europe. Did you know it at that time? Not a person in the United States knew it. You weren't permitted to know it.
<P>
Who knew it? President Wilson knew it. Colonel House knew it. Others knew it. Did I know it? I had a pretty good idea of what was going on: I was liaison to Henry Morgenthau, Sr., in the 1912 campaign when President Wilson was elected, and there was talk around the office there.
I was 'confidential man' to [Jew] Henry Morgenthau, Sr., who was chairman of the Finance Committee, and I was liaison between him and Rollo Wells, the treasurer. So I sat in these meetings with President Wilson at the head of the table, and all the others, and I heard them drum into President Wilson's brain the graduated income tax and what has become the Federal Reserve, and also indoctrinate him with the Zionist movement.
<P>
Justice Brandeis and President Wilson were just as close as the two fingers on this hand, and President Woodrow Wilson was just as incompetent when it came to determining what was going on as a newborn baby. And that's how they got us into World War I, while we all slept."
<P>
"The Zionists in London had sent cables to the United States, to Justice Brandeis, saying "Go to work on President Wilson. We're getting from England what we want. Now you go to work on President Wilson and get the United States into the war." That's how the United States got into the war. We had no more interest in it; we had no more right to be in it than we have to be on the moon tonight instead of in this room. There was absolutely no reason for World War I to be our war. We were railroaded into -- if I can be vulgar, we were suckered into -- that war merely so that the Zionists of the world could obtain Palestine. That is something that the people of the United States have never been told. They never knew why we went into World War I."
<P>
World War I broke out in the summer of 1914. Within two years, Germany had won that war. Not a shot had been fired on German soil. Not an enemy soldier had crossed the border into Germany, and yet, Germany was offering England peace terms. 
<P>
While that was occurring, the Zionists in Germany, who represented the Zionists from Eastern Europe, went to the British War Cabinet, and they said "Look here, you can  win this war yet. You don't have to give up. You don't have to accept the negotiated peace offered to you now by Germany. You can win this war if the United States will come in as your ally." 
<P>
They [Zionists] told England: "We will guarantee to bring the United States into the war as your ally, to fight with you on your side, if you will promise us Palestine after you win the war." In other words, they made this deal- "We will get the United States into this war as your ally. The price you must pay us is Palestine after you have won the war and defeated Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey." 
<P>
Now England had as much right to promise Palestine to anybody, as the United States would have to promise Japan to Ireland for any reason whatsoever. It's absolutely absurd that Great Britain [that never had any connection or any interest or any right in what is known as Palestine] should offer it as coin of the realm to pay the Zionists for bringing the United States into the war. 
<P>
However, they made that promise in October of 1916. Shortly thereafter, the United States, which was almost totally pro-German, [totally pro-German because the newspapers here were controlled by Jews, and the bankers were Jews, and all the media in this country was controlled by Jews]; they were pro-German because their people, the majority who came from Germany, wanted to see Germany defeat the Czar. 
<P>
The Jews didn't like the Czar, and they didn't want Russia to win the war. Therefore, the German bankers [the German-Jews], Kuhn, Loeb, and the other big banking firms in the United States, refused to finance France or England. They stood aside and they said, "As long as France and England are tied up with Russia, not one cent!" However, they poured money into Germany; they fought with Germany against Russia, trying to defeat the Czarist regime. 
<P>
Now those same Jews, when they became aware of the possibility of obtaining Palestine, went to England and made this deal. At that time, everything changed, like a traffic light that changes from red to green. Where the newspapers had been pro-German, where they had been telling the people of the difficulties that Germany was having fighting Great Britain commercially and in other respects; all of a sudden the Germans were no good. They were villains. They were Huns. They were shooting Red Cross nurses. They were cutting off babies' hands, and they were no good. 
<P>
Shortly thereafter, Mr. Wilson declared war on Germany. The Zionists in London sent cables to the United States, to Justice Brandeis stating: "Go to work on President Wilson. We are getting what we want from England. Now you go to work, and work on President Wilson. Get the United States into the war." That's how the United States entered into the war. We had no interest in it; we had no more right to be in it than we have to be on the moon tonight instead of in this room." [3]

"President Woodrow Wilson was the fairy godmother who provided Trotsky with a passport to return to Russia to "carry forward" the revolution. This American passport was accompanied by a Russian entry permit and a British transit visa. Jennings C. Wise, on Woodrow Wilson: Disciple of Revolution makes the pertinent comment, "Historians must never forget that Woodrow Wilson, despite the efforts of the British police, made it possible for Leon Trotsky to enter Russia with an American passport." --Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution"

"Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture are afraid of somebody, they are afraid of something. They know there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it." --Woodrow Wilson, The New Freedom [1913], Doubleday

"The present Federal Reserve System is a flagrant case of the Government’s conferring special privileges upon bankers. The Government hands credit to the banks at virtually no cost, to be loaned out for their own private profit. Still worse, is the fact that it gives the bankers practically complete control of the amount of money that will be in circulation. Not one dollar of these Federal Reserve notes gets into circulation without being borrowed into circulation and without someone paying interest to some bank to keep it circulating. Our present money system is a debt money system. Before a dollar can circulate, a debt must be created. Such a system assumes that you can borrow yourself out of debt." <BR>–Willis A. Overholser, A short review and analysis of the history of money in the United States, with an introduction to the current money problem [1936], p. 56 
<P>
Once the Jews obtained control of the Federal Reserve, they moved quickly, increasing the money supply from 1914 to 1919, much of it in loans to smaller banks. In 1920, the Jews called in the majority of all loans, sparking an identical crisis to the one in 1907 [the Jews had lied to the public telling the Fed Act passage would prevent such problems-- Hegelian anyone?]. This move wiped out over 5,400 Gentile banks outside of the official grip of the Jewish bankers, and consolidated more power under the Jewish banking Families.

"Under the Federal Reserve Act, panics are scientifically created, as the present panic is the first scientifically created one, and is worked out as we work out a mathematical equation."--Congressman Lindbergh, regarding the crash of 1920 
<P>
From 1921 to 1929, the Jewish Fed replayed this criminal robbery again, the new tool also used was the Margin loan, which allowed an investor to only have to put down 10% of a stock’s worth, with a broker loaning the other 90%. Hence the "Roaring 20's" The catch the Jews put in was the Margin loan could be called in at any time and had to be paid within 24 hours of such "Margin call" The result of such a call is the selling of the stock brought with the loan in question. 
<P>
In 1929, the Jewish bankers such as Rockefeller and others withdrew from the market out the backdoor. On Oct 24, the Margin loans are called in mass waves. Everyone began selling their stocks all at once, with the encoring crash over 16,000 banks were wiped out alone. The Jews then swooped in and bought up the entire stock market at a penny cost, putting them in control of numerous corporations across the board, and the entire economic system in general. The Jews then purposely shrank the money supply, increasing the depression to the point it is remembered to this day as "The Great Depression."

"Now that this sterling American patriot has made, the passing [McFadden], it can be revealed that not long after his public utterance against the encroaching powers of Judah, it became known among his intimates that he had suffered two attempts against his life.

May 23, 1933, Congressman, Louis T.

Congressman McFadden stated in Congress, concerning the Federal Reserve Corporation, 1934 AN ASTOUNDING EXPOSURE Reprinted by permission 1978 Arizona Caucus Club Congressman McFadden's Speech On the Federal Reserve Corporation, Quotations from several speeches made on the Floor of the House of Representatives by the Honorable Louis T. McFadden of Pennsylvania. 
<P>“Mr. McFadden, due to his having served as Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee for more than 10 years, was the best posted man on these matters in America and was in a position to speak with authority concerning the vast ramifications of this gigantic private credit monopoly. As Representative of a State which was among the first to declare its freedom from foreign money tyrants, it is fitting that Pennsylvania, the cradle of liberty, again be given the credit for producing a son that was not afraid to hurl defiance in the face of the money-bund. Whereas Mr. McFadden was elected to high office on both the Democratic and Republican tickets, there can be no accusation of partisanship lodged against him. Because these speeches are set out in full in the Congressional Record, they carry weight that no amount of condemnation on the part of private individuals could hope to carry.”
<P>
The Federal Reserve: A Corrupt Institution.
<BR>"Mr. Chairman, we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks, hereinafter called the Fed. The Fed has cheated the Government of the United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the Nation's debt. The depredations and iniquities of the Fed have cost enough money to pay the National debt several times over.
<P>
"This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the United States, has bankrupted itself, and has practically bankrupted our Government. It has done this through the defects of the law under which it operates, through the maladministration of that law by the Fed and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it.
<BR>"Some people think that the Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions. They are private monopolies that prey upon the people of the United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers; and rich and predatory money lenders. In that dark crew of financial pirates, there are those who would cut a man's throat to get a dollar out of his pocket; there are those who send money into states to buy votes to control our legislatures; there are those who maintain international propaganda for the purpose of deceiving us into granting new concessions, which will permit them to cover up their past misdeeds and set again in motion their gigantic train of crime.
<P>
"These twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully and disloyally foisted upon this Country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our American institutions. Those bankers took money out of this Country to finance Japan in a war against Russia. They created a reign of terror in Russia with our money in order to help that war along. They instigated the separate peace between Germany and Russia, and thus drove a wedge between the allies in the World War. They financed Trotsky's passage from New York to Russia so that he might assist in the destruction of the Russian Empire. They fomented and instigated the Russian Revolution, and placed a large fund of American dollars at Trotsky's disposal in one of their branch banks in Sweden so that through him Russian homes might be thoroughly broken up, and Russian children flung far and wide from their natural protectors. They have since begun the breaking up of American homes and the dispersal of American children. "Mr. Chairman, there should be no partisanship in matters concerning banking and currency affairs in this Country, and I do not speak with any.”
<P>
"In 1912, the National Monetary Association, under the chairmanship of the late Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, made a report and presented a vicious bill called the National Reserve Association bill. This bill is usually spoken of as the Aldrich bill. Senator Aldrich did not write the Aldrich bill. He was the tool, if not the accomplice, of the European bankers who for nearly twenty years had been scheming to set up a central bank in this Country and who in 1912 had spent and were continuing to spend vast sums of money to accomplish their purpose.
<P>
"We were opposed to the Aldrich plan for a central bank. The men who rule the Democratic Party then promised the people that if they were returned to power there would be no central bank established here while they held the reigns of government. Thirteen months later that promise was broken, and the Wilson administration, under the tutelage of those sinister Wall Street figures who stood behind Colonel House, established here in our free Country the worm-eaten monarchical institution of the "King's Bank" to control us from the top downward, and from the cradle to the grave.
<P>"The Federal Reserve Bank destroyed our old and characteristic way of doing business. It discriminated against our 1-name commercial paper, the finest in the world, and it set up the antiquated 2-name paper, which is the present curse of this Country and which wrecked every country which has ever given it scope; it fastened down upon the Country the very tyranny from which the framers of the Constitution sough to save us.
<P>
PRESIDENT JACKSON'S TIME
<BR>"One of the greatest battles for the preservation of this Republic was fought out here in Jackson's time; when the second Bank of the United States, founded on the same false principles of those which are here exemplified in the Fed was hurled out of existence. After that, in 1837, the Country was warned against the dangers that might ensue if the predatory interests after being cast out should come back in disguise and unite themselves to the Executive and through him acquire control of the Government. That is what the predatory interests did when they came back in the livery of hypocrisy and under false pretenses obtained the passage of the Fed.
<P>"The danger that the Country was warned against came upon us and is shown in the long train of horrors attendant upon the affairs of the traitorous and dishonest Fed. Look around you when you leave this Chamber and you will see evidences of it in all sides. This is an era of misery and for the conditions that caused that misery, the Fed is fully liable. 
<P>
This is an era of financed crime and in the financing of crime; the Fed does not play the part of a disinterested spectator.
<BR>"It has been said that the draughtsman who was employed to write the text of the Aldrich bill because that had been drawn up by lawyers, by acceptance bankers of European origin in New York. It was a copy, in general a translation of the statues of the Reichsbank and other European central banks. One-half million dollars was spent on the part of the propaganda organized by these bankers for the purpose of misleading public opinion and giving Congress the impression that there was an overwhelming popular demand for it and the kind of currency that goes with it, namely, an asset currency based on human debts and obligations. Dr. H. Parker Willis had been employed by Wall Street and propagandists, and when the Aldrich measure failed- he obtained employment with Carter Glass, to assist in drawing the banking bill for the Wilson administration. He appropriated the text of the Aldrich bill. There is no secret about it. The test of the Federal Reserve Act was tainted from the first.
<BR>"A few days before the bill came to a vote, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts, wrote to Senator John W. Weeks as follows:
<P>New York City, December 17, 1913
My Dear Senator Weeks: 
<BR>Throughout my public life I have supported all measures designed to take the Government out of the banking business.... This bill puts the Government into the banking business as never before in our history and makes, as I understand it, all notes Government notes when they should be bank notes. 
<BR>The powers vested in the Federal Reserve Board seem to me highly dangerous, especially where there is political control of the Board. I should be sorry to hold stock in a bank subject to such domination. The bill as it stands seems to me to open the way to a vast inflation of the currency. There is no necessity of dwelling upon this point after the remarkable and most powerful argument of the senior Senator from New York. I can be content here to follow the example of the English candidate for Parliament who thought it enough "to say ditto to Mr. Burke." I will merely add that I do not like to think that any law can be passed which will make it possible to submerge the gold standard in a flood of irredeemable paper currency. 
<BR>I had hoped to support this bill, but I cannot vote for it as it stands, because it seems to me to contain features and to rest upon principles in the highest degree menacing to our prosperity, to stability in business, and to the general welfare of the people of the United States. 
<P>
Very sincerely yours,
<BR>Henry Cabot Lodge"
<P>
In eighteen years that have passed since Senator Lodge wrote that letter of warning all of his predictions have come true. The Government is in the banking business as never before. Against its will, it has been made the backer of horse thieves and cardsharps, bootleggers, smugglers, speculators, and swindlers in all parts of the world. Through the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks the riffraff of every country is operating on the public credit of this United States Government. 
<P>
THE GREAT DEPRESSION
<BR>Meanwhile, and on account of it, we ourselves are in the midst of the greatest depression we have ever known. Thus the menace to our prosperity, so feared by Senator Lodge, has indeed struck home. From the Atlantic to the Pacific, our country has been ravaged and laid waste by the evil practices of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks and the interests that control them. At no time in our history has the general welfare of the people of the United States been at a lower level or the mind of the people so filled with despair. 
    <P>     Recently in one of our States 60,000 dwelling houses and farms were brought under the hammer in a single day. Recently in one of our States, 60,000 dwelling houses and farms were brought under the hammer in a single day, 71,000 houses and farms in Oakland County, Michigan, have been sold and their erstwhile owners dispossessed. Similar occurrences have probably taken place in every county in the United States. The people who have thus been driven out are the wastage of the Federal Reserve act. They are the victims of the dishonest and unscrupulous Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks. Their children are the new slaves of the auction blocks in the revival here of the institution of human slavery.
<P>
The Scheme of the Fed
<BR>In 1913, before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, Mr. Alexander Lassen made the following statement: 
But the whole scheme of the Federal Reserve bank with its commercial-paper basis is an impractical, cumbersome machinery, is simply a cover, to find a way to secure the privilege of issuing money and to evade payment of as much tax upon circulation as possible, and then control the issue and maintain, instead of reduce, interest rates. It is a system that, if inaugurated, will prove to the advantage of the few and the detriment of the people of the United States. It will mean continued shortage of actual money and further extension of credits; for when there is a lack of real money people have to borrow credit to their cost."
<P>
A few days before the Federal Reserve act was passed Senator Elihu Root denounced the Federal Reserve bill as an outrage on our liberties and made the following prediction: "Long before we wake up from our dreams of prosperity through an inflated currency, our gold, which alone could have kept us from catastrophe, will have vanished and no rate of interest will tempt it to return." 
<BR>If ever a prophecy came true, that one did. It was impossible, however, for those luminous and instructed thinkers to control the course of events. On December 23, 1913, the Federal Reserve bill became law, and that night Colonel House wrote to his hidden master in Wall Street as follows:
<P>
"I want to say a word of appreciation to you for the silent but no doubt effective work you have done in the interest of currency legislation and to congratulate you that the measure has finally been enacted into law. We all know that an entirely perfect bill, satisfactory to everybody, would have been an impossibility, and I feel quite certain that unless the President had stood as firm as he did we should likely have had no legislation at all. The bill is a good one in many respects; anyhow good enough to start with and to let experience teach us in what direction it needs perfection, which in due time we shall then get. In any event you have personally good reason to feel gratified with what has been accomplished."
<P>
The words "unless the President had stood as firm as he did we should likely have had no legislation at all," were a gentle reminder that it was Colonel House himself, the "holy monk," who had kept the President firm. 
         The foregoing letter affords striking evidence of the manner in which the predatory interests then sought to control the Government of the United States by surrounding the Executive with the personality and the influence of a financial Judas. Left to itself and to the conduct of its own legislative functions without pressure from the Executive, the Congress would not have passed the Federal Reserve act. According to Colonel House, and since this was his report to his master, we may believe it to be true, the Federal Reserve act was passed because Wilson stood firm; in other words because Wilson was under the guidance and control of the most ferocious usurers in New York through their hireling, House. The Federal Reserve act became law the day before Christmas Eve in the year 1913, and shortly afterwards the German international bankers, Kuhn, Loeb and Co., sent one of their partners here to run it.
<P>
"The Federal Reserve note is essentially unsound. As Kemmerer says: "The Federal Reserve notes, therefore, in form have some of the qualities of Government paper money, but, in substance, are almost a pure asset currency possessing a Government guaranty against which contingency the Government has made no provision whatever." Hon. E. J. Hill, a former Member of the House, said, and truly: "They are obligations of the Government for which the United States has received nothing and for the payment of which at any time it assumes the responsibility looking to the Federal Reserve to recoup itself."
<P>
If the United States Government is to redeem the Federal Reserve notes when the general public finds out what it costs to deliver this flood of paper money to the twelve Federal Reserve banks, and if the Government has made no provision for redeeming them, the first element of unsoundness is not far to seek. 
   <BR>Before the Banking and Currency Committee, when the Federal Reserve bill was under discussion, Mr. Crozier, of Cincinnati, said: "Before the Banking and Currency Committee, when the bill was under discussion Mr. Crozier of Cincinnati said: 
<BR>In other words, the imperial power of elasticity of the public currency is wielded exclusively by these central corporations owned by the banks. This is a life and death power over all local banks and all business. It can be used to create or destroy prosperity, to ward off or cause stringencies and panics. By making money artificially scarce, interest rates throughout the country can be arbitrarily raised and the bank tax on all business and cost of living increased for the profit of the banks owning these regional central banks, and without the slightest benefit to the people. These twelve corporations together cover the whole country and monopolize and use for private gain every dollar of the public currency and all public revenue of the United States. Not a dollar can be put into circulation among the people by their Government without the consent of and on terms fixed by these twelve private money trusts."
<P>
In defiance of this and all other warnings, the proponents of the Federal Reserve act created the twelve private credit corporations and gave them an absolute monopoly of the currency of the United States, not of the Federal Reserve notes alone, but of all the currency, the Federal Reserve act providing ways by means of which the gold and general currency in the hands of the American people could be obtained by the Federal Reserve banks in exchange for Federal Reserve notes, which are not money, but merely promises to pay money. Since the evil day when this was done the initial monopoly has been extended by vicious amendments to the Federal Reserve act and by the unlawful and treasonable practices of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks.  
<P>MONEY FOR THE SCOTTISH DISTILLERS
<BR>Mr. Chairman, when a Chinese merchant sells human hair to a Paris wigmaker and bills him in dollars, the Federal Reserve banks can buy his bill against the wigmaker and then use that bill as collateral for the Federal Reserve notes. The United States Government thus pays the Chinese merchant the debt of the wigmaker and gets nothing in return except a shady title to the Chinese hair. 
    <P>     
Mr. Chairman, if a Scottish distiller wishes to send a cargo of Scotch whiskey to the United States, he can draw his bill against the purchasing bootlegger in dollars; and after the bootlegger has accepted it by writing his name across the face of it, the Scotch distiller can send that bill to the nefarious open discount market in New York City, where the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks will buy it and use it as collateral for a new issue of Federal Reserve notes. Thus the Government of the United States pays the Scotch distiller for the whiskey before it is shipped; and if it is lost on the way, or if the Coast Guard seizes it and destroys it, the Federal Reserve banks simply write off the loss and the Government never recovers the money that was paid to the Scotch distiller. While we are attempting to enforce prohibition here, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks are financing the distillery business in Europe and paying bootleggers' bills with the public credit of the United States Government. 
       <P>  
Mr. Chairman, if a German brewer ships beer to this country or anywhere else in the world and draws his bill for it in dollars, the Federal Reserve banks will buy that bill and use it as collateral for Federal Reserve notes. Thus, they compel our Government to pay the German brewer for his beer. Why should the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks be permitted to finance the brewing industry in Germany, either in this way or as they do by compelling small and fearful United States banks to take stock in the Isenbeck brewery and in the German bank for brewing industries? 
<P>Mr. Chairman, if Dynamit Nobel of Germany wishes to sell dynamite to Japan to use in Manchuria or elsewhere, it can draw its bill against the Japanese customers in dollars and send that bill to the nefarious open discount market in New York City, where the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks will buy it and use it as collateral for a new issue of Federal Reserve notes, while at the same time the Federal Reserve Board will be helping Dynamit Nobel by stuffing its stock into the United States banking system. Why should we send our representatives to the disarmament conference at Geneva while the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks are making our Government pay Japanese debts to German munitions makers? 
   <P>      
Mr. Chairman, if a bean grower of Chile wishes to raise a crop of beans and sell them to a Japanese customer, he can draw a bill against his prospective Japanese customer in dollars and have it purchased by the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks and get the money out of this country at the expense of the American people before he has even planted the beans in the ground. 
      <P>   
Mr. Chairman, if a German in Germany wishes to export goods to South America or anywhere else, he can draw his bill against his customer and send it to the United States and get the money out of this country before he ships or even manufactures the goods. 
         <P>
Mr. Chairman, why should the currency of the United States be issued on the strength of Chinese human hair? Why should it be issued on the trade whims of a wigmaker? Why should it be issued on the strength of German beer? Why should it be issued on the crop of unplanted beans to be grown in Chile for Japanese consumption? Why should the Government of the United States be compelled to issue many billions of dollars every year to pay the debts of one foreigner to another foreigner? Was it for this that our national-bank depositors had their money taken out of our banks and shipped abroad? Was it for this that they had to lose it? Why should the public credit of the United States Government and likewise money belonging to our national-bank depositors be used to support foreign brewers, narcotic drug vendors, whiskey distillers, wigmakers, human-hair merchants, Chilean bean growers, and the like? Why should our national-bank depositors and our Government be forced to finance the munitions factories of Germany and Soviet Russia?
<P>
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN RANSACKED
<BR>Mr. Chairman, there is nothing like the Federal Reserve pool of confiscated bank deposits in the world. It is a public trough of American wealth in which foreigners claim rights equal to or greater than those of Americans. The Federal Reserve banks are agents of the foreign central banks. They use our bank depositors' money for the benefit of their foreign principals. They barter the public credit of the United States Government and hire it out to foreigners at a profit to themselves. 
    <P>     All this is done at the expense of the United States Government, and at a sickening loss to the American people. Only our great wealth enabled us to stand the drain of it as long as we did. 
         I believe that the nations of the world would have settled down after the World War more peacefully if we had not had this standing temptation here — this pool of our bank depositors' money given to private interests and used by them in connection with illimitable drafts upon the public credit of the United States Government. The Federal Reserve Board invited the world to come in and to carry away cash, credit, goods, and everything else of value that was movable. Values amounting to many billions of dollars have been taken out of this country by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks for the benefit of their foreign principals. The United States has been ransacked and pillaged. Our structures have been gutted and only the walls are left standing. While this crime was being perpetrated everything the world could rake up to sell us was brought in here at our own expense by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks until our markets were swamped with unneeded and unwanted imported goods priced far above their value and made to equal the dollar volume of our honest exports and to kill or reduce our favorable balance of trade. As agents of the foreign central banks, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks try by every means within their power to reduce our favorable balance of trade. They act for their foreign principals and they accept fees from foreigners for acting against the best interests of the United States. Naturally there has been great competition among foreigners for the favors of the Federal Reserve Board.
<P>
What we need to do is to send the reserves of our national banks home to the people who earned and produced them and who still own them and to the banks which were compelled to surrender them to predatory interests. We need to destroy the Federal Reserve pool, wherein our national-bank reserves are impounded for the benefit of the foreigners. We need to make it very difficult for outlanders to draw money away from us. We need to save America for Americans.
<P>
SPURIOUS SECURITIES
<BR>Mr. Chairman, when you hold a $10 Federal Reserve note in your hand you are holding a piece of paper which sooner or later is going to cost the United States Government $10 in gold, unless the Government is obliged to give up the gold standard. It is protected by a reserve of 40 per cent. or $4 in gold. It is based on Limburger cheese, reputed to be in foreign warehouses; or on cans purported to contain peas but which may contain salt water instead; or on horse meat; illicit drugs; bootleggers' fancies; rags and bones from Soviet Russia of which the United States imported over a million dollars' worth last year; on wines, whiskey, natural gas, on goat or dog fur, garlic on the string, or Bombay ducks. If you like to have paper money which is secured by such commodities, you have it in the Federal Reserve note. If you desire to obtain the thing of value upon which this paper currency is based — that is, the Limburger cheese, the whiskey, the illicit drugs, or any of the other staples — you will have a very hard time finding them. Many of these worshipful commodities are in foreign countries. Are you going to Germany to inspect her warehouses to see if the specified things of value are there? I think not. And what is more, I do not think you would find them there if you did go. 
    <P>     Immense sums belonging to our national-bank depositors have been given to Germany on no collateral security whatever. The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks have issued United States currency on mere finance drafts drawn by Germans. Billions upon billions of our money has been pumped into Germany and money is still being pumped into Germany by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. Her worthless paper is still being negotiated here and renewed here on the public credit of the United States Government and at the expense of the American people. On April 27, 1932, the Federal Reserve outfit sent $750,000, belonging to American bank depositors, in gold to Germany. A week later, another $300,000 in gold was shipped to Germany in the same way. About the middle of May $12,000,000 in gold was shipped to Germany by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. Almost every week there is a shipment of gold to Germany. These shipments are not made for profit on the exchange since the German marks are below parity with the dollar. 
<P>
Mr. Chairman, I believe that the national-bank depositors of the United States are entitled to know what the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks are doing with their money. There are millions of national-bank depositors in this country who do not know that a percentage of every dollar they deposit in a member bank of the Federal Reserve system goes automatically to American agents of the foreign banks and that all their deposits can be paid away to foreigners without their knowledge or consent by the crooked machinery of the Federal Reserve act and the questionable practices of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks.
<P>
Mr. Chairman, the American people should be told the truth by their servants in office. In 1930 we had over half a billion dollars outstanding daily to finance foreign goods stored in or shipped between countries. In its yearly total, this item amounts to several billion dollars. What goods are those on which the Federal Reserve banks yearly pledge several billions of dollars of the public credit of the United States? What goods are those which are hidden in European and Asiatic storehouses and which have never been seen by any officer of this Government, but which are being financed on the public credit of the United States Government? What goods are those upon which the United States Government is being obligated by the Federal Reserve banks to issue Federal Reserve notes to the extent of several billions of dollars a year?
<P>
The Bankers' Acceptance Racket
<BR>The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks have been international bankers from the beginning, with the United States Government as their enforced banker and supplier of currency. But it is none the less extraordinary to see those twelve private credit monopolies buying the debts of foreigners against foreigners in all parts of the world and asking the Government of the United States for new issues of Federal Reserve notes in exchange for them. 
    <P>     I see no reason why the American taxpayers should be hewers of wood and drawers of water for the European and Asiatic customers of the Federal Reserve banks. I see no reason why a worthless acceptance drawn by a foreign swindler as a means of getting gold out of this country should receive the lowest and choicest rate from the Federal Reserve Board and be treated as better security than the note of an American farmer living on American land. 
       <P>  The magnitude of the acceptance racket, as it has been developed by the Federal Reserve banks, their foreign correspondents, and the predatory European-born bankers who set up the Federal Reserve institution here and taught our own brand of pirates how to loot the people — I say the magnitude of this racket is estimated to be in the neighborhood of $9,000,000,000 a year. In the past ten years it is said to have amounted to $90,000,000,000. In my opinion, it has amounted to several times as much. Coupled with this you have, to the extent of billions of dollars, the gambling in the United States securities, which takes place in the same open discount market — a gambling upon which the Federal Reserve Board is now spending $100,000,000 per week.
<P>
Federal Reserve notes are taken from the United States Government in unlimited quantities. Is it strange that the burden of supplying these immense sums of money to the gambling fraternity has at last proved too heavy for the American people to endure? Would it not be a national calamity if the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks should again bind this burden down on the backs of the American people and, by means of the long rawhide whips of the credit masters, compel them to enter another seventeen years of slavery? They are trying to do that now. They are taking $100,000,000 of the public credit of the United States Government every week in addition to all their other seizures, and they are spending that money in the nefarious open market in New York City in a desperate gamble to reestablish their graft as a going concern.
<P>
They are putting the United States Government in debt to the extent of $100,000,000 a week, and with the money they are buying up our Government securities for themselves and their foreign principals. Our people are disgusted with the experiments of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board is not producing a loaf of bread, a yard of cloth, a bushel of corn, or a pile of cordwood by its check-kiting operations in the money market.
<P>
Mr. Speaker, on the 13th of January of this year I addressed the House on the subject of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. In the course of my remarks I made the following statement: 
In 1928 the member banks of the Federal Reserve system borrowed $60,598,690,000 from the Federal Reserve banks on their fifteen-day promissory notes. Think of it! Sixty billion dollars payable upon demand in gold in the course of one single year. The actual payment of such obligations calls for six times as much monetary gold as there is in the entire world. Such transactions represent a grant in the course of one single year of about $7,000,000 to every member bank of the Federal Reserve system. Is it any wonder that there is a depression in this country? Is it any wonder that American labor, which ultimately pays the cost of all banking operations of this country, has at last proved unequal to the task of supplying this huge total of cash and credit for the benefit of the stock-market manipulators and foreign swindlers?
<P>
"In 1933 the Fed presented the staggering amount of $60,598,690,000 to its member banks at the expense of the wage earners and tax payers of the United States. In 1929, the year of the stock market crash, the Fed advanced $58,000,000,000 to member banks."
<P>
Mr. Chairman, some of my colleagues have asked for more specific information concerning this stupendous graft, this frightful burden that has been placed on the wage earners and taxpayers of the United States for the benefit of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. They were surprised to learn that member banks of the Federal Reserve System had received the enormous sum of $60,598,690,000 from the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks on their promissory notes in the course of one single year, namely, 1928. Another Member of this House, Mr. Beedy, the honorable gentleman from Maine, has questioned the accuracy of my statement and has informed me that the Federal Reserve Board denies absolutely that these figures are correct. This Member has said to me that the thing is unthinkable, that it can not be, that it is beyond all reason to think that the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks should have so subsidized and endowed their favorite banks of the Federal Reserve system. This Member is horrified at the thought of a graft so great, a bounty so detrimental to the public welfare as sixty and a half billion dollars a year and more shoveled out to favored banks of the Federal Reserve system.
<P>
In 1930, while the speculating banks were getting out of the stock market at the expense of the general public, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks advanced them $13,022,782,000. This shows that when the banks were gambling on the public credit of the United States Government as represented by the Federal Reserve currency, they were subsidized to any amount they required by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. When the swindle began to fall, the bankers knew it in advance and withdrew from the market. They got out with whole skins and left the people of the United States to pay the piper. 
<P>
On November 2, 1931, I addressed a letter to the Federal Reserve Board asking for the aggregate total of member bank borrowing in the years 1928, 1929, 1930. In due course, I received a reply from the Federal Reserve Board, dated November 9, 1931, the pertinent part of which reads as follows: 
<BR>My Dear Congressman: 
<BR>In reply to your letter of November 2, you are advised that the aggregate amount of fifteen-day promissory notes of member banks during each of the past three calendar years has been as follows: 
<P>
1928 . . . . . . . . . . . . . $60,598,690,000
<BR>1929 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 58,046,697,000
<BR>1930 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,022,782,000
<P>
This will show the gentleman from Maine the accuracy of my statement. As for the denial of these facts made to him by the Federal Reserve Board, I can only say that it must have been prompted by fright, since hanging is too good for a Government board, which permitted such a misuse of Government funds and credit. 
   <BR>My friend from Kansas, Mr. McGugin, has stated that he thought the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks lent money by rediscounting. So they do, but they lend comparatively little that way. The real rediscounting that they do has been called a mere penny in the slot business. It is too slow for genuine high flyers. They discourage it. They prefer to subsidize their favorite banks by making these $60,000,000,000 advances, and they prefer to acquire acceptances in the notorious open discount market in New York, where they can use them to control the prices of stocks and bonds on the exchanges.
<P>
For every dollar they advanced on rediscounts in 1928 they lent $33 to their favorite banks for gambling purposes. In other words, their rediscounts in 1928 amounted to $1,814,271,000, while their loans to member banks amounted to $60,598,690,000. As for their open-market operations, these are on a stupendous scale, and no tax is paid on the acceptances they handle; and their foreign principals, for whom they do a business of several billion dollars every year, pay no income tax on their profits to the United States Government. 
<P>
The John Law Swindle
This is the John Law swindle all over again. The theft of Teapot Dome was trifling compared to it. What king ever robbed his subjects to such an extent as the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks have robbed us? Is it any wonder that there have lately been ninety cases of starvation in one of the New York hospitals? Is there any wonder that the children of this country are being dispersed and abandoned? 
   <BR>      The Government and the people of the United States have been swindled by swindlers deluxe to whom the acquisition of American gold or a parcel of Federal Reserve notes presented no more difficulty than the drawing up of a worthless acceptance in a country not subject to the laws of the United States, by sharpers not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts, sharpers with a strong banking "fence" on this side of the water — a "fence" acting as a receiver of the worthless paper coming from abroad, endorsing it and getting the currency out of the Federal Reserve banks for it as quickly as possible, exchanging that currency for gold, and in turn transmitting the gold to its foreign confederates. 
<P>
Ivar Kreuger, the Match King!
Such were the exploits of Ivar Kreuger, Mr. Hoover's friend, and his hidden Wall Street backers. Every dollar of the billions Kreuger and his gang drew out of this country on acceptances was drawn from the Government and the people of the United States through the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. The credit of the United States Government was peddled to him by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks for their own private gain. That is what the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks have been doing for many years. They have been peddling the credit of this Government and the signature of this Government to the swindlers and speculators of all nations. That is what happens when a country forsakes its Constitution and gives its sovereignty over the public currency to private interests. Give them the flag and they will sell it. 
<P>
The nature of Kreuger's organized swindle and the bankrupt condition of Kreuger's combine was known here last June when Hoover sought to exempt Kreuger's loan to Germany of $125,000,000 from the operation of the Hoover moratorium. The bankrupt condition of Kreuger's swindle was known here last summer when $30,000,000 was taken from the American taxpayers by certain bankers in New York for the ostensible purpose of permitting Kreuger to make a loan to Colombia. Colombia never saw that money. The nature of Kreuger's swindle and the bankrupt condition of Kreuger was known here in January when he visited his friend, Mr. Hoover, at the White House. It was known here in March before he went to Paris and committed suicide there.

From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt [Jew and famous Rothschild agent] to those of Karl Marx [Jew], and down to Trotsky [Jew] [Russia], Bela Kun [Jew] [Hungary], Rosa Luxembourg [Jew] [Germany], and Emma Goldman [Jew] [United States], this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. It played, as a modern writer, Mrs. Webster, has so ably shown, a definitely recognizable part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century; and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.

Being established for obvious reasons, the Jewish rule over American in all areas of life was absolute from the governments, to the economy, the Media, the schools, etc. 
The Jews were now fully entrenched in the all the key positions of power, and unleashed their own "Cultural Revolution" on American society in the radical sixties and with Cultural Marxist Jewish Frankfurt School, because Global Communism is, was and shall always be the end goal for Global Jewry.

"In this New World Order, the children of Israel will furnish all the leaders without encountering opposition.

Here Jew Rosenthal brags in an interview, of the Jewish agenda at work in America:
Harold Wallace Rosenthal, age 29, personal assistant to New York Senator Jacob Javits, in a 1976 interview with Walter White Jr., editor, Conservative monthly, Western Front:
<P>
Our power has been created through the manipulation of the national monetary system… The Federal Reserve System fitted our plan nicely since it is owned by us, but the name implies that it is a government institution.
<P>
From the very outset, our purpose was to confiscate all the gold and silver, replacing them with worthless non-redeemable paper notes. This we have done! Prior to 1968, the gullible goy could take a one dollar Federal Reserve note into any bank in America and redeem it for a dollar which was by law a coin containing 412 1/2 grains of 90 per cent silver. Up until 1933, one could have redeemed the same note for a coin of 25 4/5ths grains of 90 per cent gold. All we do is give the goy more non-redeemable notes, or else copper slugs, but we never give them their gold and silver, only more paper," he said contemptuously. "We Jews have prospered through the paper gimmick. It's our method through which we take money and give only paper in return. The stocks and bonds market, all forms of insurance and the fractional reserve system practiced by the Federal Reserve Corporation, not to mention the billions in gold and silver that we have gained in exchange for paper notes, are stupidly called money. Money power was essential in carrying out our master plan of international conquest through propaganda.
<P>
By controlling the banking system, we were able to control corporation capital. Through this, we acquired total monopoly of the movie industry, the radio networks, and the newly developing television media. The printing industry, newspapers, periodicals, and technical journals had already fallen into our hands. The richest plum was later to come when we took over the publication of all school materials. Through these vehicles, we could mold public opinion to suit our own purposes. The people are only stupid pigs that grunt and squeal the chants we give them, whether they be truth or lies.
<P>
There is no such thing as the silent majority because we control their cry and hue. The only thing that exists is an unthinking majority and unthinking they will remain, as long as their escape from our rigorous service is the opiate of our entertainment industry. By controlling industry, we have become the taskmasters and the people the slaves.
<P>
When the pressure of daily toil builds to an explosive degree, we have provided the safety valve of momentary pleasure. The television and movie industries furnish the necessary temporary distraction. These programs are carefully designed to appeal to the sensuous emotions, never to the logical thinking mind. Because of this, the people are programmed to respond according to our dictates, not according to reason. We have castrated society through fear and intimidation. Its manhood exists only in combination with a feminine outward appearance. Being so neutered, the populace has become docile and easily ruled. As all geldings in nature, their thoughts are not involved with the concerns of the future and their posterity, but only with the present toil and the next meal."
<P>
On Industry
<BR>"We have been successful in dividing society against itself by pitting labor against management. This perhaps has been one of our greatest feats, since in reality it is a triangle, though only two points ever seem to occur. In modern industry where exists capital, which force we represent, is the apex. Both management and labor are on the base of this triangle. They continually stand opposed to each other and their attention is never directed to the head of their problem. Management is forced to raise prices since we are ever increasing the cost of capital. Labor must have increasing wages and management must have higher prices, thus creating a vicious cycle.
<P>
We are never called to task for our role, which is the real reason for inflation, since the conflict between management and labor is so severe that neither has time to observe our activities. It is our increase in the cost of capital that causes the inflation cycle. We do not labor or manage, and yet we receive the profits.
<P>
Through our money manipulation, the capital that we supply industry costs us nothing. Through our national bank, the Federal Reserve, we extend book credit, which we create from nothing, to all local banks that are member banks. They in turn extend book credit to industry. Thus, we do more than God, for all of our wealth is created from nothing. You look shocked! Don't be! It's true; we actually do more than God. With this supposed capital we bring industry, management and labor into our debt, which debt only increases and is never liquidated. Through this continual increase, we are able to pit management against labor so they will never unite and attack us and usher in a debt-free industrial utopia.
<P>
We are the necessary element since we expend nothing. Management can create its own capital—the profits. Its business would grow and profits increase. Labor would prosper as well, while the price of the product would remain constant, the prosperity of industry, labor and management would continually increase.
<P>
We Jews glory in the fact that the stupid goyim have never realized that we are the parasites consuming an increasing portion of production while the producers are continually receiving less and less."
<P>
On Religion:
<BR>"Religion, too, must be taught, and through this necessity we have labored. With our control of the textbook industry and the news media, we have been able to hold ourselves up as the authorities on religion. Many of our rabbis now hold professorships in Christian theological seminaries. We are amazed by the Christians' stupidity in receiving our teachings and propagating them as their own. Judaism is not only the teaching of the synagogue, but also the doctrine of every 'Christian Church' in America. Through our propaganda, the Church has become our most avid supporter. This has even given us a special place in society, their believing the lie that we are the 'chosen people' and they, gentiles.
<P>
"These deluded children of the Church defend us to the point of destroying their own culture. This truth is evident even to the dullard when one views history and sees that all wars have been white fighting white in order that we maintain our control. We controlled England during the Revolutionary War, the North during the Civil War, and England and America during World War I and II. Through our influence of religion, we were able to involve the ignorant white Christians in wars against themselves, which always impoverished both sides while we reaped a financial and political harvest. Anytime truth comes forth which exposes us, we simply rally our forces — the ignorant Christians. They attack the crusaders even if they are members of their own families.
"Through religion we have gained complete control of society, government, and economics. No law is ever passed except its merits have previously been taught from the pulpits. An example of this is race equality which led to integration and ultimately to mongrelization. The gullible clergy in one breath instruct their parishioners that we are a special, chosen people while in another breath proclaim all races are the same. Their inconsistency is never discovered, so we Jews enjoy a special place in society while all other races are reduced to racial equality. It is for this reason that we authored the equality hoax, thereby reducing all to a lower level.
<P>
"We have been taught that our current economic practices are benevolent, therefore Christian. These pulpit parrots extol our goodness for loaning them the money to build their temples. They are eager to pay our exorbitant interest rates. They have led society into our control through the same practice. Politically, they hail the blessings of democracy and never understand that through democracy we have gained control of their nation. Their book again teaches a benevolent despotic form of government in accordance with the laws of that book, while a democracy is mob rule, which we control through their Churches, our news media and economic institutions. Their religion is only another channel through which we can direct the power of our propaganda. These religious puppets' stupidity is only exceeded by their cowardice, for they are ruled easily."
<P>
"This attitude permeates our entire being and philosophy. We are not the creators, for to create would only benefit another. We are the 'acquirers' and are interested only in satisfying the 'self.' To understand our philosophy, understand the term 'to get.' We never give but only take. We never labor, but enjoy the fruits of others' labor. We do not create but confiscate. We are not the producers but the parasites. We can physically live within any society, but always remain spiritually apart. To work would be to produce, and the highest form of that labor would be to create. Your race has always worked for the satisfaction of what it produces. We would never work for anyone's benefit, only for what we can get. We have used this Aryan attitude to achieve our greatest prosperity. You will work for the enjoyment you derive out of producing, while never being concerned about the pay. We take your productivity for a paltry fee and turn it into fortunes.
<P>
"Until recently, the pride of workmanship exceeded the quest for high incomes. However, we have been able to enslave society to our own power, which is money, by causing them to seek after it. We have converted the people to our philosophy of getting and acquiring so that they will never be satisfied. A dissatisfied people are the pawns in our game of world conquest. Thus, they are always seeking and never able to find satisfaction. The very moment they seek happiness outside themselves, they become our willing servants.
<P>
"Your people never realize that we offer them only worthless baubles that cannot bring fulfillment. They procure one and consume it and are not filled. We present another. We have an infinite number of outward distractions, to the extent that life cannot again turn inward to find its definite fulfillment. You have become addicted to our medicine through which we have become your absolute masters.
<P>
"On the first and fundamental lie, the purpose of which is to make people believe that we are not a nation but a religion, other lies are subsequently based. Our greatest fear is that this falsehood will be discovered, for we will be stamped out the moment the general public comes into possession of the truth and acts upon it. [It is one thing to put a man in possession of the truth, to get him to understand it is another, and to get him to act upon it is another still. Truth by itself has no value unless used or applied in some way.] It is becoming apparent that an awakening is occurring even here in America. We had hoped that through our devastation of Nazi Germany that any subject dealing with us would be a fearful taboo. However, there seems to be a resurgence here in the one nation that we so strongly control. We are presently making plans for a rapid exodus. We know that when the light begins to dawn, there will be no stopping it. All efforts on our part will only intensify that light and draw focus upon it.
<P>
"We fear that light is coming forth in movements across this land, especially yours. It has amazed us how you have been successful in reaching the people after we closed every door of communication. This, we fear, is a sign of a coming pogrom that will take place in America soon. The American public has realized that we are in control, which is a fatal mistake on our part. This nation could never be the land of the free as long as it is the land of the Jew. This is the revelation that will be our undoing. 
"The American people have been easily ruled through our propaganda that the pen is mightier than the sword. We virtually get away with murder, and all the goyim do is to talk about it, which is ineffective since we, the masters of propaganda, always publish a contradicting account. If the Aryan would review history and apply those lessons of the past, then the pen will be thrown down in disgust and the sword wielded in the heat of passion. [A recurrence to history would edify our minds and show us that the European countries solved their Jewish problem only by use of force]. Thus far, we have escaped the sword, when the only reprisal is some periodical of no repute, or some pamphlet with limited circulation. Their pen is no match for ours, but our constant fear is that they may open their eyes and learn that no change was ever brought about with a pen. History has been written in blood, not with ink. No letter, editorial, or book has ever rallied the people or stopped tyranny. We understand this principle and are continually propagandizing the people to write letters to the President, to Congress and to their local media. We are safe to continually exploit, intimidate, and disenfranchise the white American as long as they are preoccupied with the illusion of educating the masses through printed material. Woe be unto us if they ever see the futility of it, lay down the pen and employ the sword.
<P>
"History confirms the fact that the passions of an aroused minority, no matter how small a group, have exerted enough power to topple the greatest empire. The movements that control destiny are not those that rest on the inactive majority; but on the sheer force of an active minority. Will is power, not numbers, for a strong will, will always rule the masses!"
<P>
"Again, we are safe as long as our Will is stronger, or the Will of the people is misdirected, scattered and without leadership. We will never be deposed with words, only force!"
