The Kosher Food Tax is the biggest consumer fraud existing in
America. Examine every item in your cupboards for either the (U) or
(K) labels. These symbols represent a Jewish "blessing" and when
these small symbols are detected, it means that you have unwittingly
paid a tax to a Jewish religious group. They will not always be on
the front of the package; they may be hidden amid the small print
near the label's seam. This cryptic code has to do with a
Hebrew "secret," a heist, which illuminates the Jews' power in the
United States.


<P>The circled "U," sometimes with the word "Parve," stands for Union
of Orthodox Jews (UOJCA), the "K" stands for Kosher (KOV K). Both
will not be found on the same package. These symbols mean that the
product's producer paid the Jews a kind of "tax" to have some
rabbi "bless" it.

<P>Don't confuse these letters with the letter "R" which stands for
registered trade mark or a letter "C" which stands for copyright.
These two letters will probably be there too. You have now
discovered what the Jews call "hechsers," a rip-off code found on
most grocery items.

<P>In 1959, the Wall Street Journal estimated that this massive Jewish
payola at about $20 million. That is almost forty years ago. Since
that time, the Jewish owned Wall Street Journal has remained silent.
The rip-off is thought to be in the hundreds of millions today. The
Jewish Post of July 30, 1976 reported that Rabbi Harvey Sentor
admitted that Kov K was a "profit-making concern." The UOJCA
extracts exactly the same levy as Kov K, and in exactly the same way.

<P>Jews, of course, defend these "blessings" in any way they can, but
what this rip-off really boils down to for the Gentile is legalized
extortion. After all, the Jews represent but 2.9% of the population.
It is not an option for the Gentile to have this "tax" removed from
products he buys or have the little Jewish letters erased. He has to
pay this "tax" to the Jews whether he wants to or not.

<P>If this were nothing more than a bizarre religious ceremony, giving
rabbinical approval to food and food products prepared in a specific
way to meet an unusual diet, then why are steel wool and kitchen
utensils also included? The Jews have a strange diet indeed! If
these "blessings" are so important to Jews, why do they charge for
them? You would think that they would be willing to give this
service free--for benefit of their own people--and perhaps pay
something to food product companies for providing this Kosher
identification. Instead, it's the reverse--companies have to pay to
have the Kosher identification.

<P>Since Jews represent a small percent of America's population, why is
it that they place most of the burden of this "tax" on the shoulders
of the Gentile? Why have the Gentile consumers been so silent for so
long about this perennial extortion by the Jews? And since this
burden comes off as a "tax," don't Gentiles have a right to know
where and how this money is spent? How on earth do the Jews get away
with this daylight robbery? The answer is that the Jewish blessing
agencies wield enormous power through Jewish domination of the
retail and distribution trades..and Jews own America's press. Non-
compliance by a food producer would quickly bring about a Jewish
boycott of the product. Bankruptcy!

<P>Here is how this clever scheme works. An Orthodox Rabbi will
approach a company and warn the owners that unless their product is
certified as Kosher, or "fit for a Jew to eat", they will face a
boycott by every Jew in America. Once they succumb to this
BLACKMAIL, they are required to keep the total amount paid the
Rabbis every year a strict secret!

<P>The growth of this Kosher racket has been nothing less than
phenomenal. In 1960, only 225 food products paid the Kosher tax. By
1966, this figure grew to 476 and jumped to 1000 by 1974. Today, a
whopping 17,500 companies have been intimidated into paying this
multi-level tax.

<P>How The Kosher Tax Operates


<P>The Union of Orthodox Rabbis which issues the (U) symbol controls
80% of the Kosher certification business. They employ some 300
Rabbis who travel nation-wide "inspecting" food processing plants.
First, the company must pay an annual fee for the use of the
copyright symbol--the (U) or (K) or a version thereof. Second, the
company must pay a separate heavy fee each time a team of Rabbis
shows up to "inspect" their plant (Certain meat packers are required
to hire Rabbis full time at extravagant salaries). Third, the
company must pay these fees over and over again for each different
product they make.

<P>Thus, General Foods pays dozens of separate fees. Also, each sub-
contracting company which provides any type of ingredient which goes
into the finished product must also pay separate fees to
the "visiting Rabbis". Sometimes a single product may eventually be
taxed as many as a dozen times right down the line before it reaches
you the consumer! Last, but not least, these fees must be paid
annually and they are increased each year.

<P>Only by increasing the public awareness of the Kosher Food Tax and
doing our best to refrain from purchasing products with the "K"
or "U" symbols, can we begin to end this outrage being perpetrated
upon our people. With the purchasing power of the dollar less all
the time, we cannot afford this outrage to continue unchecked.

<P><I>In addition to the above article, I would like to add if this is their code, just what are they putting into the foods without the code? This code is more than "kosher" is represents food that is safe to consume for the Jews.</i>
