You should take a couple of minutes to <a href="../../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Aura_Cleaning.html">clean your aura</a> before beginning this exercise. The meditation is performed in 18 breaths. <a href="About_MKB.html">Click Here</a> for information about this meditation.
<p>PLEASE NOTE: THIS MEDITATION HAS BEEN UPDATED 10/15/12. THE MOST POWERFUL CHAKRA IS THE 3RD [SOLAR, 666, SUN] CHAKRA, NOT THE HEART CHAKRA. THE SPHERE SHOULD BE MOVED TO THE SOLAR CHAKRA, NOT THE HEART CHAKRA, AS WAS IN THE FORMER MEDITATION FOR STEP 14. <br>FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS, PLEASE <a href="../../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Chakra_Alignment.html">CLICK HERE</a>

<p><blockquote>From now on, with each and every breath throughout the meditation, you will draw in and visualize energy entering through both ends of the breathing tube at the same time.</blockquote>

The tube is transparent like glass.<br>The next three illustrations below are without the pyramid for clarity.

<br><br>Visualize your disk and the pyramids spinning so fast (the speed of light is 186,000 miles per second) they give off intense white light and energy, hold  for six and blow for six. This will stabilize the disk. 
<br><br>It is strongly advisable to remain in meditation, meditating upon the energy for 5-15 minutes afterwards, concentrating on feeling the pulsating sensation of the disk.
