Here is an excerpt from "The White Man's Bible" By Ben Klassen:

<P>UNRELENTING WARFARE BETWEEN THE PARASITIC JEWS AND THEIR UNFORTUNATE
VICTIMS
<P><span>Antagonism goes back 5,000 years.</span>
<BR> Listening to today’s Jewish manipulated news and
propaganda, the overwhelming number of the American public have the impression that hostility
toward Jews is merely a recent isolated phenomenon invented by Adolf Hitler. They have been
told over and over that the Jews are sweet, kind people just like everyone else, (only more so)
and it is only because of the demented, paranoid prejudices of that wild man, Adolf Hitler, that
the Jews have been unfairly picked upon for no reason at all. We are led to believe that before
Hitler came along there was never any conflict between the Jews and the rest of the world.


<P><span>Irreconcilable Conflict.</span><BR> Nothing could be further from the truth. The conflict between the
parasitic Jew and their long-suffering hosts throughout the civilized world is as old as
history itself. That conflict is as basic as that between the pioneer mother and the rattlesnake I
referred to in an early chapter. It is irreconcilable, is a matter of life and death, and will continue
until either the Jews are exterminated or the White Race is destroyed. The reason for this is
inherent in the Talmudic religion of the Jews themselves which regards all Gentiles as eternal
enemies to be exploited, robbed, fleeced and manipulated for the benefit of the Jews. How they
do so is the subject of several other chapters in this book.


<P><span>Parasites of Civilization.</span><BR> In this particular chapter we want to show that the Jews have been
dreaded and detested parasites on the backs of civilized nations from time immemorial; that they
have been thrown out of just about every civilized White nation in the world, not only once, but
repeatedly out of the same country, or the same region, or the same city.


<P><span>From the Mouth of the Jews.</span><BR> The evidence we produce here is not from “biased” Gentile
sources, but on the contrary, is taken directly from the Jews’ own records. Much of the
information given here is derived mainly from Jewish encyclopedias, which are written by Jews,
about Jews, and principally for Jews. In it we find that the Jews have been expelled, massacred,
driven out, hated and detested by just about every country and city that they have infested. This
has happened not only once, but repeatedly, going back into history as far as the time they were
run out of Egypt in the second millennium B.C. (about 3,500 years ago). Although this was not
necessarily the first, it is the first major Jewish expulsion history has recorded.
Series of Backlash. However, in this analysis we are mostly concerned about the conflict
between Jews and Gentiles in Europe. The attacks were spontaneous and can be numbered in the
thousands in villages, cities and countries. We find the attacks against the Jews at certain times
ran in a campaign or a series and were given certain names.


<P><span>The Armleder Series:</span><BR> Name given to leaders of attacks on German Jews 1336-39, which
were responsible for massacres in over 100 places in Alsace, Swabia and Franconia.
The Black Death Massacres: These ran partially at the same time but over a wider area of
Europe and a longer span of time. The Jews were accused (and rightfully so) of poisoning wells
during the Black Plague and dropping diseased bodies into drinking water and thereby spreading
and aggravating the plague. Attacks took place in Poland, Spain, France, Catalonia and Northern
Italy. In Germany alone attacks took place in 350 places, while 60 large and 150 small Jewish
communities were exterminated.


<P>Bogdan Chmielnicki was a Cossack leader (1593-1657). In 1648 he headed a retaliatory
uprising of the Ukraine. This resulted in the annihilation of hundreds of Jewish communities and
the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews, a contemporary source confirming that 744 Jewish
communities were wiped out. The Jews refer to these as the Chmielnicki massacres.

<P><span>Hep! Hep! Riots: Anti-Jewish slogan used during the riots in Germany in 1819, a cry
originating from the time of the Crusades.</span>
<BR>Rindfleish Massacres: Series of exterminatory attacks on Jews throughout Franconia and
surrounding regions in 1298, after a Ritual Murder accusation. Led by a Bavarian noble named
<BR>Rindfleish, 146 Jewish communities were annihilated.
<BR>Simon Petrula (1880-1926): Ukrainian leader, who, with forces under his command (1918-
20), carried out 493 pogroms in which 16,706 Jews were killed.

<P>* * * * *

<P>Besides these series, there are certain terms that the Jews use again and again in the
attacks on them, terms that are not ordinarily understood by non-Jews.
Pogrom: An organized massacre for the annihilation of a community or a mass group of
Jews.

<P><span>Ritual Murder or Blood Libel Accusations: </span><BR>One of the most abhorrent and depraved of
religious rituals indulged in by the Jews over the centuries. The procedure is to kidnap some
young Christian, usually a boy 6 to 8 years old, (sometimes a girl) into a secret room in a
synagogue. The victim is tied down to a table, stripped, and his or her body pierced with sharp
ritual knives in the identical places the nails supposedly entered the body of Christ. The blood is
drained into cups and drunk by the Jews as part of the Passover Ritual.

<P>[<I>This is obvious what this is for- the symbolic ritual direction of the energy- human blood sacrifice- to keep the lie of Christianity going and Gentiles under the spell. This practice still goes on today. There is always a higher number of missing children around passover time.</i>]


<P>The Jews deny this bestial practice, and refer to them only as accusations. The fact is that
they have not only been accused of this same bestial practice since Roman times, but have been
convicted of it and hanged, decapitated and burned at the stake for this crime in practically every
country of Europe (as we will see) and even in some of the Moslem countries. The murdered
baby of Charles Lindberg is alleged to have been a victim of Jewish Ritual Murder in recent
times. After personally studying the case, I am convinced that it is true, since it certainly fits the
pattern.
<BR>[<I>Here is more<a href="https://www.jewwatch.com/jew-atrocities-blood-libel.html">information</a> regarding Jewish murder and torture of Gentile children.</I>] 


<P>* * * * *


<P><span>Tenacious Jews keep coming back. </span>
<BR>We will note that in a number of countries or cities the
Jews were run out of (expelled), sometimes as many as five or six times. To the uninitiated this
raises the question— how could the Jews be run out of a certain city and then be expelled out of
the same city again 20 years later? The answer is that the Jews are like cockroaches. They are
the most tenacious race in history and they always come back no matter how many have been
killed, expelled, or how much they are detested by their host victims. They always come back,
that is, if the city is fertile soil for their parasitic manipulations. We must remember that Jews
are parasites, and parasites have to live on others, on a productive body. In the case of Jews their
best victim is a thriving White community. For the same reason fleas will infest a dog again and
again, or a house has to have pest control treatments every month to keep out cockroaches and
other insect pests, so it is with the Jews. They always return to re-infest a productive
community.

<P><span>Perpetual Warfare.</span><BR> To show how widespread has been the Jewish infestation over the ages
and how universal the hostility against them, we will review the fluid warfare between Jewish
infestation and the Gentile attempt to rid themselves of these parasites. Our information is
from Jewish sources themselves and due to lack of space represents only a small capsule of the
total available.

<P>* * * * *

<P><span>ANCIENT TIMES
<BR>Egypt:</span>
<BR> Although the conflicts between Jews and host civilizations precede written records,
the oldest major expulsion we have on record is when the Jews were driven out of Egypt because
they had become insufferable. The date is approximately the middle of the Second millenium
B.C. Centuries later the Jews came back in huge numbers and Alexandria became a center of
heavy infestation. Grave riots against the Jews in Alexandria broke out in 38 A.D. and again in
66 A.D. There were further disturbances by the Jews which were suppressed with extreme
cruelty. In 115-17 Alexandrian Jews were heavily attacked and their Great Synagogue burned.
In 414 A.D. the Jews were again expelled from that city.


<P><span>Asia:
<BR> In Medina, a city in Arabia,</span> Mohammed, who at first had been friendly to the Jews, in
622 A.D. either expelled or massacred them all, and no Jews have been allowed there since.
Seleucia is an ancient city on the Tigris. Jews flocked into this city after the destruction of
Arulia and Asinia. This resulted in a wholesale massacre of the Jews in 40 A.D., but they came
back.


<P><span>Byzantine Empire:</span><BR> Justinian, Emperor from 527 to 565, adopted a thorough-going anti-
Jewish policy, barring them from civil service, military posts and any other positions of
influence. This policy was adhered to in the ensuing centuries and is undoubtedly a major reason
why the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire survived the Western Roman Empire by a thousand
years.


<P><span>Rome: </span><BR>The oldest continuing Jewish community in Europe was established in Rome, with
records dating back to 139 B.C., but they undoubtedly were there much earlier. Cicero, the great
Roman statesman and man of letters, recognized the Jews as an organized hostile element as
early as 50 B.C. and frequently attacked them in his Senate speeches. Emperor Tiberius expelled
the Jews from Rome in 19 A.D. but they soon returned. Emperor Claudius expelled a number of
Jews from Rome in 49-50 A.D. In 116 A.D. Emperor Trajan ordered a preventative massacre of
Jews in Mesopotamia, since they were the cause of perpetual turmoil and uprisings in that area.
As Roman conquest and culture spread over Europe, Rome was the original center from which
Jewish loan bankers spread out ot Northern Italy and then to the rest of Europe. Despite threats
and vicissitudes against the Jews, the Popes generally helped to protect the Jews from an
outraged populace.


<P>* * * * *


<P><span>MEDIEVAL EUROPE


<P>Dispersed from Rome.</span><BR> Spreading out from Rome and following Roman conquests, the
Jews spread over Europe. As civilization, industry and commerce advanced to the individual
areas and cities, the parasitical Jew followed and sank deep his tentacles into his baffled hosts.
Dog and Flea Situation. Since we do not have the space, the following presents only a
thumbnail sketch of repeated Jewish invasions and the reactions of their beleaguered hosts, who
never really knew how to deal with the Jewish phenomenon. Like the dog and flea situation, the
dog wants to be rid of the fleas, but never learned how to do it.

<P><span>Perpetual War.</span><BR> However brief, the following gives a representative picture of the eternal
warfare between the blood-sucking Jew and the attempts of the White Gentiles in Europe to repel
them. We will take the countries in alphabetical order.



<P>AUSTRIA
Ritual Murder. The 13th to 15th centuries were marked by serious persecutions. In 1420 as
a result of a charge of Ritual Murder, all Jews in Austria were either burned, expelled or forcible
baptized. They did not disappear, however, and in 1670 Margaret Theresa decreed another
general expulsion.


<P><span>In Salzburg,</span><BR> the Jewish community was massacred during the Black Death outbreak, 1349,
and again following a Host Desecration charge in 1404. They were expelled by the Archbishop
in 1498. In the province of Tyrol the Jews were accused of well poisoning at the time of the
Black Death. As a further result of a Ritual Murder charge in 1475, the Jewish communities in
Trent, Rinn and Lienz were destroyed, and finally in 1520 all Jews were expelled from Tyrol.
No Stemming of the Tide. There was a hostile, but ineffective reaction to their return. Karl
Lueger (1844-1910) who was Mayor of Vienna from 1897 dismissed entrenched Jewish
officials, introduced segregation into public schools and took other anti-Jewish measures.
However, it had little effect in stemming the Jewish tide, until the Hitler Anschluss of Austria in
1938.



<P><span>ENGLAND</span><BR>
<BR>Came with the Norman Conquest. Jews first swarmed into England with the Norman
Conquest of 1066. They soon became oppressive tax collectors for the Crown and monopolized
finances, trade and commerce. In 1144 the first Ritual Murder accusation was brought against
them in Norwich, and Chaucer (1340-1400) wrote about the Ritual Murder of Hugh of Lincoln in
1255. At the time of the Third Crusade, 1189-90, there were serious riots against the Jews all
over the country, accompanied by much bloodshed. Antagonism grew further because of their
financial manipulations and chicanery and they were finally expelled form the whole country
by King Edward I in 1290.


<P>In London, the Jewish headquarters, the Jews were well established before 1100. There
was a murderous attack on the Jews at the time of the coronation of Richard I in 1189, and
several more during the Baron’s Wars of 1263-66. The Jews in London faced Ritual Murder
accusations in 1238, 1244 and 1276.
<BR>Doors opened by Oliver Cromwell. Oliver Cromwell was the Jews’ Chabez-goi who
opened the floodgates in 1655 and the Jews swarmed in again en masse. By 1696 the Jews had
control of the Bank of England and have retained control of banking, finance and government
ever since.


<P><span>FRANCE</span><BR>
<BR>Early Infestation. The Jewish infestation of France began comparatively early, preceding
70 A.D., and by the ninth century France was the main center of activity of the
international Jewish traders, called the Radanites. By the 11th and 12th centuries the Jewish
communities in France became the most densely settled in the world. This produced a hostile
reaction and due to their nefarious practices they were excluded from the crafts and trades. The
Jews then more and more monopolized money-lending and finance, strangling the commerce
of the Gentiles.


<P><span>Ritual Murder.</span><BR> Murderous attacks against the Jews became common after the First Crusade
(1096). As in many other countries, as they were expelled from one area, they moved into
another area, and soon back again to the original site. In Blois, the first Ritual Murder charge in
1171 resulted in 31 Jews being burnt at the stake. At the time of the Fourth Crusade (1235-36) a
massacre of Jews in Brittany culminated in their expulsion in 1391. In the city of Carcassone,
the Jews were temporarily expelled in 1253, again in 1306 and finally in 1394. After a Ritual
Murder in the province of Dauphine they were expelled in 1253, but returned in 1289. After
1305 a series of expulsion orders were enforced against the Jews in the province of Gascony,
culminating in the general expulsion of 1394.



<P><span>Jews engineered the French Revolution.</span><BR> In the rest of France a general expulsion had
been decreed and forcefully carried out in 1306. For the next several centuries Jewish
activities in France were subdued, but flared up radically in the decades before the French
Revolution, which the Jews engineered. After executing the King and Queen in 1793 and
plunging Europe into 20 years of fratricidal warfare, the Jews were fully in the saddle again.
During the French Revolution they systematically guillotined the French nobility and the
French leadership. This extermination and the next 20 years of the Napoleonic Wars bled to
death the cream of the French nation. France has never recovered.



<P><span>GERMANY</span><BR>
<BR>Intensive Enmity. In no country has the warfare over the centuries been as bitter and
intensive as between the Jews and the German people. Whereas countries like England, France,
Spain during the Middle Ages were (more or less) unified under one ruler and capable of
expelling the Jews (more or less) out of the entire country in 1290, 1306 and 1492, respectively,
the fragmented Germans were never in such a position until 1871. By that time it was too late,
and the Jews too powerful and too well entrenched on a world-wide basis. During Medieval
times when one German dukedom or principality would throw them out, they would just run to
the adjoining territory, multiply, and soon be back. Never could any meaningful cleansing be
effected throughout the German land. Nevertheless, the Jewish hatred for the Germans, and
vice-versa, was most virulent in the German states and to this day the German people are the
primary target of genocide by the international Jewish network.



<P>The history of warfare between the Jews and the Germans is a long one and we can only give
a small fragment here.
<BR>By 1090 the Jews had become so obnoxious and insufferable that the Crusaders killed the
Jews in the Rhineland, the area of densest Jewish settlement in Germany at that time.
Jews Intensified Epidemic. During the Black Death epidemic (1348-49) the Jews were
charged with spreading the plague by poisoning wells and dropping infected bodies in wells. In
Germany alone during this time attacks on Jews took place in about 350 areas, while 60 large
and 150 small Jewish communities were exterminated. Many towns thereafter tried to banish the
Jews for all time, but the Jews always returned, as we shall see.



<P><span>Middle ages Continual Warfare.</span><BR> In Breslau the Jewish community was wiped out in 1349.
In 1453 an accusation of Host Desecration led to the killing of 41 Jews and the banishment of the
rest. In Coblenz the Jews suffered persecutions in 1265, 1281 and 1287, and from Armleder
attacks in 1337. The Jewish community was wiped out during the Black Death Massacres of
1349, but they returned by 1356 and were again banished from the entire province of Trier in
1418. Jewish activity in Dresden was first recorded in 1375. By 1448 they were run out
because of their activities of counterfeiting coins and aiding the Hussites.



<P><span>Jews Monopolized Finances.</span><BR> The Jewish community was expelled from Dusseldorf in
1438 but returned late in the 16th century. Despite anti-Jewish riots in Erfurt in 1221, the
Jewish community continued to develop until the Black Death Massacres of 1349, when the
survivors were banished. They returned in 1357 and were run out again in 1458. The Jewish
community in Frankfurt-Am-Main was annihilated in 1241 and again by the Flagellants in
1349. The Jews in Frankfurt monopolized moneylending and finance in the Middle Ages and
even today Frankfurt is one of the world’s more important Jewish financial centers. The
Fettmilch riots in 1614 led to a temporary expulsion and the War of 1796 resulted in the
destruction of a large part of the Jewish ghetto in Frankfurt.



<P><span>Black Death Massacres.</span><BR> In the city of Halberstadt, the Jews were run out in 1493,
returned in the next century and again driven out in 1594. The Jews’ main activity in the city of
Leipzig was money lending. They were annihilated in the Black Death massacres of 1349, but
others returned. The Jews in Mainz were expelled as early as 1012 but soon returned. Hundreds
were killed by Crusaders in 1096, despite the Bishop’s protection, but others soon returned. A
series of massacres ensued at the time of the Black Death (1349), but the Jews kept coming back.
Expulsion edicts were issued in 1438, 1462 and 1470-71.


<P><span>Rindfleish Massacres.</span><BR> In Nuremberg, where the Jews had settled in the 12th century, their
main activity was also money-lending. The Jewish community was destroyed in 1298 during the
Rindfleish massacres, when 728 Jews were killed. During the Black Death massacres (1349)
562 were killed and the remainder ousted. Due to their insidious money-lending intrigues they
were again expelled in 1499.



<P><span>Court Jews Manipulated Rulers.</span><BR> Jews were present in the area before the German state of
Prussia was even formed. When Frederick William became the Grand Elector, Jewish power
expanded rapidly. They became “Court Jews,” money-lenders, mint-masters, army purveyors
and the aristocracy of the community.


<P><span>Returned Repeatedly.</span><BR> In the ancient and beautiful city of Rothenburg the Jewish
community was destroyed during the Rindfleisch massacres of 1298, was renewed, and again
destroyed in 1349. The Jews again returned, again were repulsed in 1349. The Jews again
returned, again were repulsed in 1397 after massacres. They returned again in 1402 and were
driven out in 1520.


<P><span>Charged with Well-Poisoning.</span><BR> In 1348 in the city of Stuttgart, the Jews were burnt on
charges of well-poisoning and spreading the Black Plague. There were a number of expulsions
in the succeeding centuries. The story in Trier was similar. The Jewish community was
destroyed in 1349, infiltrated back in a few decades, was again driven out in 1418 and returned
in 1500.



<P><span>Always Returned.</span><BR> The above pattern can be repeated in just about every German city, every
German state. Wherever the Jews settled they became obnoxious parasites and were driven out
time and time again by an outraged populace. But they always returned to sink their tentacles
deeper. They learned from their previous mistakes and became more cunning in neutralizing the
community they set about to exploit and strangle.



<P><span>Thirty Years’ War instigated by Jews.</span><BR> Toward the close of the Middle Ages most of the
German cities had repeatedly banished Jews. But they always returned in larger numbers. The
fratricidal Thirty Years’ War (1618-48) over Christianity pitted Catholics against Protestants.
It was provoked and instigated by the Jews, destroyed 65% of the German population and
80% of the buildings and property. It left the German nation in shambles, more fragmented
than ever into small jealous petty states. It set the German nation back perhaps 300 years, but, as
usual, the Jewish position greatly benefited thereby. The fragmented, impoverished states turned
to the Jews as money-lenders. Many of the key positions were filled by Court Jews, military
purveyors, financial advisers, tax collectors, money-lenders and many other vital areas. Jewish
power and infestation grew until the Hitler era.



<P><span>POLAND</span>
<BR>Heavy infestation of Khazar Jews. The Jewish infestation began in the 9th Century and
was reinforced by aggressive Khazar elements at the time. Despite pogroms, massacres and
expulsions, the Jewish infestation increased until in the 19th century and by the first part of
the 20th century Poland had the largest Jewish population (percentage-wise) in the world.
Chmielnicki Uprisings. Ritual Murders by Jews brought retaliations in Posen in 1399 and
in Cracow in 1407. Students in Cracow began anti-Jewish riots in 1401, and attacks took place
in Cracow, Lvov, Posen and elsewhere. They were driven out of Warsaw in 1483, out of
Cracow in 1491. The Chmielnicki uprisings against the Jews (1648-49) destroyed hundreds of
Jewish communities. Economic restrictions (against Jews), pogroms, and Ritual Murder charges
were recurrent throughout Poland. Thousands were killed by the Haidmak disorders of 1768 in
the Ukraine.


<P><span>Jews Constituted 50% of Urban Population.</span><BR> After 1815 the bulk of Poland was under
Russian rule and its Jewish history continued under Russia. By 1828 Jews constituted 50% of
the urban population of Poland, making it the most heavily Jew-infested country in the world.
Looking at the reaction in some of the major cities we find a Jewish pogrom occurred in
Bialystok as late as 1906. In the city of Kalisch there was a whole series of persecutions,
beginning in the 14th century. In 1656 the Jewish community in Kalisch was destroyed by
Polish General Czarniecki.


<P>In 1399 a Host Desecration charge in Posen resulted in the killing of a rabbi and 13 elders,
and anti-Jewish outbreaks occurred there in 1468, 1577 and 1687. Jews living in Warsaw were
persecuted in 1454 as a result of (Italian Franciscan preacher) Capistrano’s incitement and were
expelled out of the city in 1483.


<P><span>Jews monopolized Grain Trade.</span><BR> Jews settled in Pinsk in the 16th century and soon
monopolized the grain trade. Jews suffered severely in the Chmielnicki massacres of 1648-49
and also the Swedish Wars of 1700. Nevertheless by the beginning of World War II, the
population of Pinsk was 70% Jewish. By 1939 there were 360,000 Jews living in the City of
Warsaw, one of the highest concentrations in Europe at the time.



<P><span>RUSSIA
<br>Intense Hatred. Huge Jewish Population. </span>The hatred between the people of Russia and
the Jews is one of the most intense in the history of the universally detested Jews. Before World
War I, Russia had 5,600,000 Jews within its borders, the largest total concentration or Jews
in any country in the world up to that time, being only later exceeded by the Jewish
population of the United States at the present time.


<P>90% of Today’s Jews are of Khazar Descent. Part of the heavy Jewish infestation was due
to the Khazars, a rapacious Turkish tribe that had built an empire between the Black Sea and the
Caspian Sea and extending northward into the middle of what is now Russia. The Khazars
converted to Judaism under King Bulan in the 8th century A.D. It is estimated that 90% of
today’s Jews are descendants of the Khazars, rather than Palestinian Jews, although either is
equally vicious.


<P><span>Conquered by Yaroslav.</span><BR> In 1083 Russian Archduke Yaroslav conquered the Khazars and
incorporated their kingdom into Russia proper. Little did the Russians realize the virulence of
the plague that they had assumed to assimilate. The real warfare, however, did not begin until
the 16th century.


<P>In 1563, 300 Jews were drowned at Polotosk and Vitelisk. In 1648 Bogdan Chmielnicki
headed a rebellion of Cossack and Ukrainian masses against Jews and Polish landowners. This
resulted in the annihilation of hundreds of Jewish communities, one Jewish source claiming 744
Jewish communities were wiped out and hundreds of thousands of Jews killed. The Jews have
termed these as the Chmielnicki massacres.



<P><span>Jews Expelled from Ukraine.</span><BR> When the Ukraine was annexed to Russia in 1667 the Jews
were expelled from Ukrainian territory. Clauses prohibiting the Jews from visiting Russia were
inserted in treaties signed by Russia with foreign powers in 1550 and 1678. Expulsion orders
were issued in 1727, 1738 and 1742. In 1753 a total of 35,000 Jews were driven out of Russia.
In 1762 Catherine the Great permitted aliens to live in Russia, except Jews. In 1791 by decree
she limited Jews to a restricted area called the Pale of Settlement, and then they could live
only in the towns of that area.



<P><span>Jews Not Assimilable.</span><BR> Czar Alexander I expelled 20,000 Jews from the province of Vitebsk
and Mohilev in 1824. Czar Alexander II attempted to assimilate and to Russify the Jews, but
without success. In retaliation he was assassinated in 1881 by Jewish revolutionaries. The
Russians reacted with new pogroms, regarding the Jews as a subversive element to be kept apart
from the village population and enacted the May Laws. In 1891 the Jews were run out of
Moscow.


<P><span>Jews Foment Revolution.</span><BR> Hostility and warfare between the Russian people and the Jews
accelerated, reaching its climax with the Beilis case (1911-13) on a Ritual Murder charge in
Kiev. The Jews were highly organized for revolution. In 1905 they attempted a revolutionary
overthrow of the Russian government, but failed.



<P><span>Revolution Successful. Communism Established. </span><BR>During Russia’s involvement and
defeat in World War I and the subsequent Jewish-communist revolution they were, however,
overwhelmingly successful. The Jews shot the Czar, threw all of Russia into a revolutionary
turmoil and in 1917 established a communist-bolshevik government completely under their
control. In the ensuing years of turmoil, revolution and famine, the Jews took vicious revenge
and murdered over 30 million White Russians, thereby exterminating the best elements of the
Russian population. Therewith they destroyed any existing or potential Russian opposition or
leadership, as they had done in France 125 years earlier.


<P><span>Jews firmly in control of largest Slave Labor Camp in the world.</span><BR> Today, more than sixty
years later, the Jews are still in firm control, having established the most fiendish and brutal
slave-labor camp in the world.
<br>The Jewish Encyclopedia cites long lists of cities and areas in which pogroms, expulsions
and massacres occurred, but the list of events is too massive to record here.


<P><span>SPAIN</span>
<br>Jews Betrayed Spain to Arab Invaders. Jews entered Spain as early as the 6th century
B.C., coming in with the Phoenician traders. From 612 A.D. a relentless warfare ensued
between the natives and the Jews, marked by sporadic outbreaks and massacres. The Jews
helped the Arabs invade Spain in 711 by betrayals from within. For several centuries the Jews
prospered under the Arabs and Spain became the foremost Jewish center of that time. In the
Christian part of Spain Jews became tax collectors and “Court Jews,” and soon controlled both
the government and the economy. The infestation became so flagrant (20-25% of the population
were Jews) and so oppressive the Spaniards reacted.



<P><span>Moslems Expelled Jews.</span> In Granada in 1066 while still under Moslem rule the Jews were
attacked and expelled. The Jewish community re-established itself but was again uprooted by
the Almohades (Moslem) invasion in 1148 and Jews were either expelled or converted to the
Moslem religion. In Cordova Jews were also expelled or converted by the Almohades in 1147.
Marranos False Christians. In the Christian part of Spain a wave of massacres against the
Jews swept the country in 1391, especially in Cordova, Granada, Segovia and Seville, and many
of them became baptized Marranos, openly professing Christianity, but remaining secret Jews at
heart, loyal to the Jewish race and religion.


<P><span>Sought Control of Catholic Church.</span><BR> Soon these false Christians began acquiring control of
the Catholic Church itself. Along with the real Jews, they now controlled the church, the
government and the economy, and dissolution, turmoil and rot ensued.


<P><span>Spaniards institute the Inquisition.</span><BR> When the Spaniards again woke up to the fact that the
Jews were the cause of their misery, they again reacted. Under the leadership of Ferdinand and
Isabella the Inquisition was instituted to ferret out the disguised Jews parading as Christians
(known as Marranos). This process went on simultaneously while the Spaniards were fighting
an all-out war to drive the Mohammedan Moors out of Spain. In this war the Marranos and the
Jews were perpetually betraying the Christians in favor of the Moors. Further massacres of the
Jews broke out sporadically in many cities.


<P><span>Spain Expels Moors, Jews in 1492.</span><BR> Finally, in 1492, after ten years of warfare, Ferdinand
and Isabella succeeded in driving out the Moors and uniting Spain. (We devote a whole chapter
to this dramatic episode in history in our earlier book, NATURE’S ETERNAL RELIGION.) That same
year they decreed that all Jews were to get out of Spain by August 1st. This was carried out with
resolution and determination, culminating in the largest mass expulsion of Jews up to that time.
Having rid herself of the Jews, the history of Spain then blossomed into what is known as its
Golden Age. For the next three centuries Spain prospered. She was the leader in colonization
and worldwide expansion in the New World, the Philippines and elsewhere.



<P><span>Stranglehold On Spain.</span><BR> However, the tenacious Jews marked Spain for economic
strangulation and revenge. By the 1930’s they were powerful enough to tear Spain apart again.
They fomented and instigated a terribly destructive fratricidal Civil War that left Spain in
shambles. With the help of Hitler and Mussolini that war was successfully resolved against the
Jewish communists with Franco heading the new Fascist government.

<P><span>CONCLUSION</span>
<BR>Jewish Menace Old As History. From the foregoing short history of the Jews we have
overwhelming evidence that the Jewish problem was not invented by Adolf Hitler in the 20th
century, but on the contrary that the Jews have been a vicious parasite on the backs of
civilizations for thousands of years. Since such parasites concentrate on preying on productive
peoples, they have been a curse and a burden to the White peoples far more than the mud
peoples.
