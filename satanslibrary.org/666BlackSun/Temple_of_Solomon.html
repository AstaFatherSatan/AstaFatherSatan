Now, for those of you who think <A 
href="NEW_WORLD_ORDER.html">Modern 
Freemasonry</A> is of Satan, think again. Modern Freemasonry, which was 
originally a Gentile order, has been infiltrated and taken over by Jews. 
<P>Here is an excerpt from the book “Rule by Secrecy” by Jim Marrs, © 2000, 
pages 58 - 59: <BR><I>“This secretive banking dynasty was begun by Mayer Amschel 
Bauer, a German Jew born on February 23, 1744, in Frankfurt…” “Young Mayer 
studied to become a Rabbi. He was particularly schooled in Hashkalah, a blending 
of religion, Hebrew law, and reason” “The death of his parents forced Mayer to 
leave rabbinical school and become an apprentice at a banking house. 
<P>Quickly learning the trade, he became court financial agent to William IX, 
royal administrator of the Hesse-Kassel region, and a prominent Freemason. He 
ingratiated himself to William, who was only one year older than himself, by 
joining his interest in Freemasonry and antiquities. Mayer would search out 
ancient coins and sell them to his benefactor at greatly reduced prices. 
Considering his rabbinical training, coupled with his serious searches for 
antiquities, he surely developed a deep understanding of the ancient mysteries 
particularly those of the Jewish Cabala. It was during this same period that the 
metaphysics of the Cabala began to fuse with the traditions of Freemasonry." 
</I>
<P>The Jews infiltrate every source of Gentile power they can. From the inside, 
they either gain total control or they seek to rot it out and destroy it, 
through corruption. 
<P>Modern Freemasonry is now geared to the rebuilding of the "Temple of 
Solomon." Anyone who knows about the biblical construction of this edifice knows 
our Demons, namely Asmodeus, were viciously abused and coerced into constructing 
it against their will by the Jew "Solomon" aka "Shlomo." As quoted from "Legends 
of the Jews by Lewis Ginzberg, Asmodeus was "in chains." As most of us already 
know, the Goetic (Gothic) Demons (Gods of the Gentiles) were bound and degraded 
for centuries. Asmodeus explained much to me and answered most of my questions. 
The Jewish "Temple of Solomon" is an allegory and the underlying theme of the 
Judeo/Christian bible. The entire bible is a subliminal tool using the directed 
psychic power of the masses, and reinforced with occult power and magick. 
<P>It goes like this: <BR>Solomon had unimaginable vast wealth. The "Temple of 
Solomon" symbolizes the Jewish people (Israel) as a whole. 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>1 Kings 4: 1 So king Solomon was king over all Israel. <BR>20 Judah and 
  Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and 
  drinking, and making merry. <BR>21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from 
  the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they 
  brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. <BR>22 And 
  Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and 
  threescore measures of meal, <BR>23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the 
  pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, 
  and fatted fowl. <BR>24 For he had dominion over all the region on this side 
  the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the 
  river: and he had peace on all sides round about him. <BR>25 And Judah and 
  Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan 
  even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. <BR>26 And Solomon had forty 
  thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 
  <BR>27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that 
  came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 
  <BR>28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto 
  the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. <BR>29 
  And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of 
  heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. <BR>30 And Solomon’s wisdom 
  excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the 
  wisdom of Egypt. <BR>31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the 
  Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame 
  was in all nations round about. <BR>32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: 
  and his songs were a thousand and five. <BR>33 And he spake of trees, from the 
  cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the 
  wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of 
  fishes. <BR>34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, 
  from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom. </LI></UL>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>1 Kings 10: 21 And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and 
  all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none 
  were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. <BR>22 For 
  the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three 
  years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, 
  and peacocks. <BR>23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for 
  riches and for wisdom. <BR>24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his 
  wisdom, which God had put in his heart. <BR>25 And they brought every man his 
  present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and 
  spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. <BR>26 And Solomon gathered 
  together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred 
  chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for 
  chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.</LI></UL>
<P>"Solomon" also had several hundred wives and an overabundance of everything 
else. 
<P>Ok, now what becomes of the Gentiles? Read on... 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>1 Kings 9: 20 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, 
  Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, 
  <BR>21 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children 
  of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a 
  tribute of bondservice unto this day. <BR>22 But of the children of Israel did 
  Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his 
  princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen. 
</LI></UL>
<P><FONT size=4>The Gentiles who were not "UTTERLY DESTROYED" by the "Children 
of Israel" were made into SLAVES. GET IT??????</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>The Gentile Gods enslaved by the Jews and viciously abused, 
following with the mass murder and enslavement of the remaining Gentile people. 
Asmodeus explained to me that the "Temple of Solomon" is the "empire of the 
Jews." 
<P>The Nazarene is another allegory where the 12 apostles represent the 12 
tribes of Israel and he unites them. The whole damned bible is nothing more than 
a powerful subliminal working with an allegory where the Jews create their own 
fictitious history (stolen from Gentile legends and twisted), usurp all of the 
knowledge (Solomon asked the Jewish "God" for wisdom, as knowledge is the key to 
all things) from the Gentiles who were mass murdered and tortured to death as 
witches and so forth (those who had occult knowledge), remaining Gentiles are 
then enslaved at the hands of the Jews who control all of the wealth and the 
power. The above biblical scriptures say it all. 
<P>The Nazarene is also said to be a direct descendent of "Solomon." The theme 
of the entire Christian program is one of debt and owing. "Adam and Eve" 
"sinned" so humanity must pay. This is just one of numerous examples. Everyone’s 
got to be sorry and pay up. So there is the subliminal on debt and owing. 
Everyone’s got to be sorry. This subliminal trash is drummed into the minds of 
Gentiles from day one.

<P><IMG src="666.gif"> is the Kabbalistic square 
of the Sun. 666 is the all-important solar chakra. The true meaning of the 
"Temple of Solomon" is the <I>TEMPLE OF THE SUN.</I> Please Note: The true 
meaning of the "Temple of the Sun" is spiritual. The Jews completely corrupted 
this. "Sol" "Om" and "On" are all words for the Sun. "Sol" is the Latin word for 
the Sun and is close to the English word "soul." "Om" is a name given by the 
Hindus to the Spiritual Sun and "On" is an Egyptian word for Sun. The symbolism 
of the Temple of Solomon was stolen by the Jews and corrupted into a fictitious 
character, as with the fictitous nazarene and nearly everything in the 
Judeo/Christian Bible. For more information: <BR><A

    <TD vAlign=top>Please Note: The true meaning of the "Temple of the Sun" is 
      spiritual. This symbolizes the perfected soul, where the rays from the 
      solar [666] chakra, which is the center of the soul and circulates 
      spiritual energy, radiates into 8 separate rays. The shining soul is 
      symbolized by the sun. 8 is the number of Astaroth. This is also "The New 
      Jerusalem." The name of "Jerusalem" has also been stolen and corrupted 
      into a city in Israel. "Jerusalem" IS A CONCEPT!
