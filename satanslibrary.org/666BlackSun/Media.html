<P>&nbsp;<P>&nbsp;<center><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=5>The Jewish Run Media</center></font>
<body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ff0000" link="#c0c0c0" alink="#FF0000"vlink="#8b31c7">
<P><BR><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=3><B>The media is a powerful tool. It shapes public opinion as most people are indoctrinated to "have faith" to do as their are told, and not to think for themselves. The Jews have the entire media from the film industry to the local news tied up. Jews are in all of the key positions, no different from their control of the Catholic Church and the Protestant World Council of Churches. 

<P>The average Jew, though lacking in creative ability, has an IQ of 135 (100 is normal). This is above the 98th percentile of the population. In addition, most are college educated. While high intelligence and advanced education are desirable and noteworthy, the problem lies in what these self-appointed "Chosen of God" are doing to the detriment of the Gentile peoples in their relentless quest for Jewish world domination. 

<P>These people have played both sides against the middle for centuries in order to deceive the Gentiles. A prime example is how Israel is openly democratic, but works to promote communism behind the scenes. In order to further add more deception, the Jewish run media would forever whine and publicize any injustices committed against the Jewish people in the former Soviet Union. Unbeknownst to many, the Jews had full control of the Kremlin from the beginning. This was just a front. They don't care how many of their own they have to sacrifice to reach their goals. Their success comes from controlling both sides.

<P>If you can understand the above, the program of Christianity is so obvious. On one hand, they claim to be against Christianity, but behind the scenes, they run the entire program as they are all in key positions. Pope John Paul II, who was born of a Jewish mother (Katz) is only one of a long line of Jewish Catholic popes. There are also many Catholic Cardinals, Bishops and high ranking clergy who are Jews, all controlling the important positions. Publically claiming persecution by Christians is very clever as most people don't even stop to think. Nearly every book about the Inquisition makes it blatant that the Jews were victimized, though the authors fail to mention that the Inquisition itself was run and operated by Jews in the Catholic Church. All of this is to create a diversion and distraction, same as the Christian concept of the character of the Devil keeps Christians fearful and under their control. 



<P>The Jewish controlled media has always been behind blaspheming the True Creator God Satan,
and making the Original Gods into monsters and spooks. They demean them, and make them look like buffons to the world. 
A perfect example is
a movie found in most video stores titled "Dagon." 
Dagon was God of the Gentile Phoenicians and
Philistines. The box has a hideous looking monster on it and is of
the "horror" genre. The number of demeaning movies about Satan is endless. He is depicted as the epitome of all evil, shown as a threatening monster out to possess souls and damn them to an everlasting fire, among other things.

<P>While the Jews openly protest Christianity, they promote it behind the scenes. Christians get the prime time slots and much positive publicity from the Jewish media. Christianity is a program with a means to an end. It is a stepping off point to atheism which is the essence of communism. Promoting communism, where all spiritual power is given up and denyed is the real purpose of the bible. Because Christianity is a false religion, little or nothing ever happens in the way of spirituality. Intelligent people who can think for themselves often turn to atheism while the sheep remain enslaved. The goal of Jewish communism is the Jewish run state becomes "God" and all belief in and knowledge of spirituality is destroyed. Spiritual powers are kept in the hands of a controlling few - again Jews. The goal of Christianity is to make people believe spiritual power and anything of the occult and spirit world is nothing but fiction. Again, they play both sides against the middle as the Jewish movie producers and script writes will publically take the heat for ridiculing Christianity in movies and sitcoms, but behind the scenes, they promote it. 

<P>&nbsp;<P>Below is an excerpt of an article revealing the extent of the control the Jews have over our media:

<P>The Facts of Jewish Media Control


<P>Electronic News & Entertainment Media


<P>The largest media conglomerate today is Walt Disney Company, whose
chairman and CEO, Michael Eisner, is a Jew. The Disney Empire,
headed by a man described by one media analyst as a "control freak",
includes several television production companies (Walt Disney
Television, Touchstone Television, Buena Vista Television), its own
cable network with 14 million subscribers, and two video production
companies.

<P>As for feature films, the Walt Disney Picture Group, headed by Joe
Roth (also a Jew), includes Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures,
and Caravan Pictures. Disney also owns Miramax Films, run by the
Weinstein brothers. When the Disney Company was run by the Gentile
Disney family prior to its takeover by Eisner in 1984, it epitomized
wholesome, family entertainment. While it still holds the rights to
Snow White, under Eisner, the company has expanded into the
production of graphic sex and violence. In addition, it has 225
affiliated stations in the United States and is part owner of
several European TV companies.

<P>ABC's cable subsidiary, ESPN, is headed by president and CEO Steven
Bornstein, a Jew. This corporation also has a controlling share of
Lifetime Television and the Arts & Entertainment Network cable
companies. ABC Radio Network owns eleven AM and ten FM stations,
again in major cities such as New York, Washington, Los Angeles, and
has over 3,400 affiliates. Although primarily a telecommunications
company, Capital Cities/ABC earned over $1 billion in publishing in
1994. It owns seven daily newspapers, Fairchild Publications,
Chilton Publications, and the Diversified Publishing Group.

<P>Time Warner, Inc, is the second of the international media
leviathans. The chairman of the board and CEO, Gerald Levin, is a
Jew. Time Warner's subsidiary HBO is the country's largest pay-TV
cable network. Warner Music is by far the world's largest record
company, with 50 labels, the biggest of which is Warner Brothers
Records, headed by Danny Goldberg. Stuart Hersch is president of
Warnervision, Warner Music's video production unit. Goldberg and
Hersch are Jews. Warner Music was an early promoter of "gangsta
rap." Through its involvement with Interscope Records, it helped
popularize a genre whose graphic lyrics explicitly urge Blacks to
commit acts of violence against Whites.

<P>In addition to cable and music, Time Warner is heavily involved in
the production of feature films (Warner Brothers Studio) and
publishing. Time Warner's publishing division (editor-in-chief
Norman Pearlstine, a Jew) is the largest magazine publisher in the
country (Time, Sports Illustrated, People, Fortune).

<P>When Ted Turner, a Gentile, made a bid to buy CBS in 1985, there was
panic in media boardrooms across the nation. Turner made a fortune
in advertising and then had built a successful cable-TV news
network, CNN. Although Turner employed a number of Jews in key
executive positions in CNN and had never taken public positions
contrary to Jewish interests, he is a man with a large ego and a
strong personality and was regarded by Chairman William Paley (real
name Palinsky, a Jew) and the other Jews at CBS as uncontrollable: a
loose cannon who might at some time in the future turn against them.

<P>Furthermore, Jewish newsman Daniel Schorr, who had worked for
Turner, publicly charged that his former boss held a personal
dislike for Jews. To block Turner's bid, CBS executives invited
billionaire Jewish theater, hotel, insurance, and cigarette magnate
Laurence Tisch to launch a "friendly" takeover of the company, and
from 1986 till 1995 Tisch was the chairman and CEO of CBS, removing
any threat of non-Jewish influence there. Subsequent efforts by
Turner to acquire a major network have been obstructed by Levin's
Time Warner, which owns nearly 20 percent of CBS stock and has veto
power over major deals.

<P>Viacom, Inc, headed by Sumner Redstone (born Murray Rothstein), a
Jew, is the third largest megamedia corporation in the country, with
revenues of over $10 billion a year. Viacom, which produces and
distributes TV programs for the three largest networks, owns 12
television stations and 12 radio stations. It produces feature films
through Paramount Pictures, headed by Jewess Sherry Lansing. Its
publishing division includes Prentice Hall, Simon & Schuster, and
Pocket Books. It distributes videos through over 4,000 Blockbuster
stores. Viacom's chief claim to fame, however, is as the world's
largest provider of cable programming, through its Showtime, MTV,
Nickelodeon, and other networks. Since 1989, MTV and Nickelodeon
have acquired larger and larger shares of the younger television
audience.

<P>With the top three, and by far the largest, media companies in the
hand of Jews, it is difficult to believe that such an overwhelming
degree of control came about without a deliberate, concerted effort
on their part. What about the other big media companies? Number four
on the list is Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which owns Fox
Television and 20th Century Fox Films. Murdoch is a Gentile, but
Peter Chermin, who heads Murdoch's film studio and also oversees his
TV production, is a Jew. Number five is the Japanese Sony
Corporation, whose U.S. subsidiary, Sony Corporation of America, is
run by Michael Schulhof, a Jew. Alan Levine, another Jew, heads the
Sony Pictures division.

<P>Most of the television and movie production companies that are not
owned by the largest corporations are also controlled by Jews. For
example, New World Entertainment, proclaimed by one media analyst
as "the premiere independent TV program producer in the United
States," is owned by Ronald Perelman, a Jew. The best known of the
smaller media companies, Dreamworks SKG, is a strictly kosher
affair. Dream Works was formed in 1994 amid great media hype by
recording industry mogul David Geffen, former Disney Pictures
chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, and film director Steven Spielberg, all
three of whom are Jews. The company produces movies, animated films,
television programs, and recorded music. Two other large production
companies, MCA and Universal Pictures, are both owned by Seagram
Company, Ltd. The president and CEO of Seagram, the liquor giant, is
Edgar Bronfman Jr., who is also president of the World Jewish
Congress.

<P>It is well known that Jews have controlled the production and
distribution of films since the inception of the movie industry in
the early decades of the 20th century. This is still the case today.
Films produced by just the five largest motion picture companies
mentioned above--Disney, Warner Brothers, Sony, Paramount (Viacom),
and Universal (Seagram)--accounted for 74 per cent of the total box-
office receipts for the first eight months of 1995.

<P>The big three in television network broadcasting used to be ABC,
CBS, and NBC. With the consolidation of the media empires, these
three are no longer independent entities. While they were
independent, however, each was controlled by a Jew since its
inception: ABC by Leonard Goldenson, CBS first by William Paley and
then by Lawrence Tisch, and NBC first by David Sarnoff and then by
his son Robert.

<P>Over periods of several decades, these networks were staffed from
top to bottom with Jews, and the essential Jewishness of network
television did not change when the networks were absorbed by other
corporations. The Jewish presence in television news remains
particularly strong.

<P>As noted, ABC is part of Eisner's Disney Company, and the executive
producers of ABC's news programs are all Jews: Victor Neufeld (20-
20), Bob Reichbloom (Good Morning America), and Rick Kaplan (World
News Tonight). CBS was recently purchased by Westinghouse Electric
Corporation. Nevertheless, the man appointed by Lawrence Tisch, Eric
Ober, remains president of CBS News, and Ober is a Jew. At NBC, now
owned by General Electric, NBC News president Andrew Lack is a Jew,
as are executive producers Jeff Zucker (Today), Jeff Gralnick (NBC
Nightly News), and Neal Shapiro (Dateline).

<P>The Print Media After television news, daily newspapers are the most
influential information medium in America. Sixty million of them are
sold (and presumably read) each day. These millions are divided
among some 1,500 different publications. One might conclude that the
sheer number of different newspapers across America would provide a
safeguard against Jewish control and distortion. However, this is
not the case. There is less independence, less competition, and much
less representation of our interests than a casual observer would
think.

<P>The days when most cities and even towns had several independently
owned newspapers published by local people with close ties to the
community are gone. Today, most "local" newspapers are owned by a
rather small number of large companies controlled by executives who
live and work hundreds or ever thousands of miles away.

<P>The fact is that only about 25 per cent of the country's 1,500
papers are independently owned; the rest belong to multi-newspaper
chains. Only a handful are large enough to maintain independent
reporting staffs outside their own communities; the rest depend on
these few for all of their national and international news.

<P>The Newhouse empire of Jewish brothers Samuel and Donald Newhouse
provides an example of more than the lack of real competition among
America's daily newspapers: it also illustrates the insatiable
appetite Jews have shown for all the organs of opinion control on
which they could fasten their grip. The Newhouses own 26 daily
newspapers, including several large and important ones, such as the
Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Newark Star-Ledger, and the New Orleans
Times-Picayune; the nation's largest trade book publishing
conglomerate, Random House, with all its subsidiaries; Newhouse
Broadcasting, consisting of 12 television broadcasting stations and
87 cable-TV systems, including some of the country's largest cable
networks; the Sunday supplement Parade, with a circulation of more
than 22 million copies per week; some two dozen major magazines,
including the New Yorker, Vogue, Madmoiselle, Glamour, Vanity Fair,
Bride's, Gentlemen's Quarterly, Self, House & Garden, and all the
other magazines of the wholly owned Conde Nast group.

<P>This Jewish media empire was founded by the late Samuel Newhouse, an
immigrant from Russia. The gobbling up of so many newspapers by the
Newhouse family was in large degree made possible by the fact that
newspapers are not supported by their subscribers, but by their
advertisers. It is advertising revenue--not the small change
collected from a newspaper's readers--that largely pays the editor's
salary and yields the owner's profit.

<P>Whenever the large advertisers in a city choose to favor one
newspaper over another with their business, the favored newspaper
will flourish while its competitor dies. Since the beginning of the
20th century, when Jewish mercantile power in America became a
dominant economic force, there has been a steady rise in the number
of American newspapers in Jewish hands, accompanied by a steady
decline in the number of competing Gentile newspapers--primarily as
a result of selective advertising policies by Jewish merchants.

<P>Furthermore, even those newspapers still under Gentile ownership and
management are so thoroughly dependent upon Jewish advertising
revenue that their editorial and news reporting policies are largely
constrained by Jewish likes and dislikes. It holds true in the
newspaper business as elsewhere that he who pays the piper calls the
tune.

<P>Three Jewish Newspapers


<P>The suppression of competition and the establishment of local
monopolies on the dissemination of news and opinion have
characterized the rise of Jewish control over America's newspapers.
The resulting ability of the Jews to use the press as an unopposed
instrument of Jewish policy could hardly be better illustrated than
by the examples of the nation's three most prestigious and
influential newspapers: the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal,
and the Washington Post.

<P>These three, dominating America's financial and political capitals,
are the newspapers which set the trends and the guidelines for
nearly all the others. They are the ones which decide what is news
and what isn't, at the national and international levels. They
originate the news; the others merely copy it, and all three
newspapers are in Jewish hands.

<P>The New York Times was founded in 1851 by two Gentiles, Henry
Raymond and George Jones. After their deaths, it was purchased in
1896 from Jones's estate by a wealthy Jewish publisher, Adolph Ochs.
His great-grandson, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr., is the paper's
current publisher and CEO. The executive editor is Max Frankel, and
the managing editor is Joseph Lelyveld. Both of the latter are also
Jews. The Sulzberger family also owns, through the New York Times
Co., 33 other newspapers, including the Boston Globe; twelve
magazines, including McCall's and Family Circle with circulations of
more than 5 million each; seven radio and TV broadcasting stations;
a cable-TV system; and three book publishing companies. The New York
Times News Service transmits news stories, features, and photographs
from the New York Times by wire to 506 other newspapers, news
agencies, and magazines.

<P>Of similar national importance is the Washington Post, which, by
establishing its "leaks" throughout government agencies in
Washington, has an inside track on news involving the Federal
government. The Washington Post, like the New York Times, had a non-
Jewish origin. It was established in 1877 by Stilson Hutchins,
purchased from him in 1905 by John McLean, and later inherited by
Edward McLean.

<P>In June 1933, however, at the height of the Great Depression, the
newspaper was forced into bankruptcy. It was purchased at a
bankruptcy auction by Eugene Meyer, a Jewish financier. The
Washington Post is now run by Katherine Meyer Graham, Eugene Meyer's
daughter. She is the principal stockholder and the board chairman of
the Washington Post Co. In 1979, she appointed her son Donald
publisher of the paper. He now also holds the posts of president and
CEO of the Washington Post Co. The Washington Post Co. has a number
of other media holdings in newspapers, television, and magazines,
most notably the nation's number-two weekly newsmagazine, Newsweek.

<P>The Wall Street Journal, which sells 1.8 million copies each
weekday, is the nation's largest-circulation daily newspaper. It is
owned by Dow Jones & Company, Inc., a New York corporation which
also publishes 24 other daily newspapers and the weekly financial
tabloid Barron's, among other things. The chairman and CEO of Dow
Jones is Peter Kann, who is a Jew. Kann also holds the posts of
chairman and publisher of the Wall Street Journal.

<P>Most of New York's other major newspapers are in no better hands
than the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The New York
Daily News is owned by Jewish real-estate developer Mortimer B.
Zuckerman. The Village Voice is the personal property of Leonard
Stern, the billionaire Jewish owner of the Hartz Mountain pet supply
firm.

<P>Other Mass Media


<P>The story is pretty much the same for other media as it is for
television, radio, and newspapers. Consider, for example,
newsmagazines. There are only three of any note published in the
United States: Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News and World Report. Time,
with a weekly circulation of 4.1 million, is published by a
susidiary of Time Warner Communications.

<P>The CEO of Time Warner Communications, as mentioned above, is Gerald
Levin, a Jew. Newsweek, as mentioned above, is published by the
Washington Post Company, under the Jewess Katherine Meyer Graham.
Its weekly circulation is 3.2 million. U.S. News & World Report,
with a weekly circulation of 2.3 million, is owned and published by
Mortimer Zuckerman, a Jew. Zuckerman also owns the Atlantic Monthly
and New York's tabloid newspaper, the Daily News, which is the sixth-
largest paper in the country.

<P>Among the giant book-publishing conglomerates, the situation is also
Jewish. Three of the six largest book publishers in the U.S.,
according to Publisher's Weekly, are owned or controlled by Jews.
The three are first-place Random House (with its many subsidiaries,
including Crown Publishing Group), third-place Simon & Schuster, and
sixth-place Time Warner Trade Group (including Warner Books and
Little, Brown). Another publisher of special significance is Western
Publishing. Although it ranks only 13th in size among all U.S.
publishers, it ranks first among publishers of children's books,
with more than 50 percent of the market. Its chairman and CEO is
Richard Snyder, a Jew, who just replaced Richard Bernstein, also a
Jew.

<P>The Effect of Jewish Control of the Media


<P>These are the facts of Jewish media control in America. Anyone
willing to spend several hours in a large library can verify their
accuracy. I hope that these facts are disturbing to you, to say the
least. Should any minority be allowed to wield such awesome power?
Certainly, not and allowing a people with beliefs such as expressed
in the Talmud, to determine what we get to read or watch in effect
gives this small minority the power to mold our minds to suit their
own Talmudic interests, interests which as we have demonstrated are
diametrically opposed to the interests of our people.

<P>By permitting the Jews to control our news and entertainment media,
we are doing more than merely giving them a decisive influence on
our political system and virtual control of our government; we also
are giving them control of the minds and souls of our children,
whose attitudes and ideas are shaped more by Jewish television and
Jewish films than by their parents, their schools, or any other
influence.
