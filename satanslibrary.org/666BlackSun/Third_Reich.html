<I> "We will have to deal with Christianity in a tougher way than hitherto.  We must settle accounts with this Christianity, this greatest of plagues that could have happened to 
us in our history, which has weakened us in every conflict.  If our generation does 
not do it, then I believe it would drag on for a long time.  We must overcome it within 
ourselves." 
</I><BR>-- Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler; Speech to top leaders of the SS, June 9, 1942 Berlin
 
 
<P><I>“National Socialist and Christian conceptions are incompatible. The Christian churches are build upon men’s ignorance; by contrast [National Socialism] rests upon scientific foundations. 
When we [National Socialists] speak of belief in God, we do not mean, like the na&iuml;ve Christians and their spiritual exploiters, a man-like being sitting around somewhere in the universe. The force governed by natural law by which all these countless planets move in the universe, we call omnipotence or God. The assertion that this universal force can trouble itself about the destiny of each individual being, every smallest earthly bacillus, can be influenced by so-called prayers or other surprising things, depends upon a requisite dose of naivety or else upon shameless professional self-interest.”
</I><BR>–</I>Martin Bormann

Many people due to misinformation, mistakenly believe that Nazi Germany was friendly to Christianity. This is not true by any stretch of the imagination. For those who are utterly confused, this website proves beyond any doubt that not only were the Nazis anti-Christian, but the Third Reich Leaders were actively working to destroy Christianity, both the Catholic and Protestant Churches. 
 
<P>The numerous occult symbols, namely the swastika, and the SS rune symbols are not only anti-Christian, but are labeled as 'Satanic' by the Christian Churches. Each of the links here provide numerous references and documented quotes by each of the top Third Reich Leaders concerning their hatred of Christianity and their intent to completely destroy it and return to pre-Christian Paganism. In truth, if one does enough research, "Satanism" is a catch-all label for Paganism. "Satan" means 'ENEMY' in Hebrew. 'Satan' is the enemy to the Jewish people. Satan is the God of the Gentiles. The Leaders of the Third Reich knew this. <BR>'Satanism' is a collective label for Paganism. 'Pagan' means 'Gentile.'
<BR>[See <A HREF="rabbis.html">'What the Jewish Rabbis have to say about Satan'</a>]
 
<P><I>“For the Mosaic religion is really nothing but a doctrine for the
preservation of the Jewish race. Hence, it embraces nearly every branch of
sociological, political, and economic knowledge that could ever come into
question in connection with it.
</I><BR>Adolf Hitler – Mein Kampf
 
<P><I>“Inside the dining hall, Himmler and his Inner Circle would perform various occult exercises, which included attempts to communicate with the spirits of dead Teutons and efforts to influence the mind of a person in the next room through the concentration of will-power. There was no place for Christianity in the SS, and members were actively encouraged to break with the Church.”
 
<p><I>New religious ceremonies were developed to take the place of Christian ones; for instance, a winter solstice ceremony was designed to replace Christmas (starting in 1939 the word ‘Christmas’ was forbidden to appear in any official SS document), and another ceremony for the summer solstice. Gifts were to be given at the summer solstice ceremony rather than at the winter solstice.</table>
<br>
Besides Christmas, weddings and christenings were also replaced by pagan rituals, and pagan myths, as we saw earlier in this chapter, influenced Himmler’s choice of Wewelsburg as the SS order castle. The meticulous work of Peter Levenda [ Unholy Alliance: A History of Nazi Involvement with the Occult by Peter Levenda (May 24, 2002)] in unearthing previously unpublished documents from the period allows us to consider the pagan world view of the Ahnenerbe and the SS. The files of the Ahnenerbe contained an article by A. E. Muller originally published in a monthly journal called Lower Saxony in 1903, which describes the celebration of the summer solstice at the Exsternsteine monument near the Wewelsburg in the mid-nineteenth century.”
<br>
“As Levenda notes, these motifs are common in the volkisch underpinnings of Nazism, with the serpent, thought of as an archetype of evil in Christianity, considered sacred by the Aryans.”</I>

<P><I>“Central to the secret initiation that these senior SS generals received was the real significance of the anagram ‘SS’ itself. For the ‘rank and file elite’ of the SS, the initials stood for the word Schutzstaffel, a term meaning. loosely a special staff or military unit. But to the initiates, there was another meaning of ‘SS’ altogether, a meaning with roots deep in the occult and in ancient Sumerian, Babylonian, and to a certain extent, Egyptian belief. For these initiates, the letters ‘SS’ referred to the die Schwarze Sonne, the Black Sun.”</i>
