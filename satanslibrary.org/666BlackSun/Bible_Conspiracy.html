<P><BR><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=3>The Bible is a Jewish conspiracy. 
Christians are deluded under a powerful spell. Christianity is nothing more than 
a vicious program, with the goals of: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Forcing the Gentiles to give up all occult knowledge and power so all 
  psychic power is in the hands of select Jews for total control. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Indoctrinating the Gentile masses into pacifism and a slave-like 
  mentality of servitude <BR><BR>
  <LI>Encouraging the Gentiles into giving up all money and worldly goods which 
  is funneled into the hands of the ruling Jews and their Gentile lackeys like 
  Billy Graham. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Preparing the Gentile masses for a one world communist slave state with 
  the ruling Jews in control. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Channeling Gentile psychic energy and prayers into the "Second coming of 
  Christ" which is in reality the Jewish Messiah as any working of the mind must 
  have a connection. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Cutting the Gentiles off from their own Tribal Gods and Demi-Gods, whose 
  identities have been altered and replaced with fictitious Jewish characters. 
  Our True Creator God has been denegrated, viciously and heinously insulted and 
  blasphemed and relegated to the enemy of humanity. </LI></UL>
<P><I>"May his name and memory be blotted out."</I><BR>--The Jewish Talmud 
<p><I>"We shall destroy God"</I>
<BR>--Quote from the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion
 
<P><BR>The list is endless and it is so glaringly obvious what was done. Now, we 
all know the Nazarene is fictitious. The Jews themselves know it and don't 
believe in him as he is a lie based upon some 20+ crucified "saviors" stolen 
from Gentile pantheons around the world. 
<P>I have put a lot of effort and time into researching the Bible, as so many 
people have serious hang-ups because of intense indoctrination with Christiainty 
and the psychic power that has gone into it. It is obvious the Bible is a hoax 
and a lie. 
<P><BR>
<P>"We shall now endeavor to answer the question which must naturally arise in 
the minds of all who see for the first time, the similarity in the legends of 
the Hebrews and those of other nations, namely: have the Hebrews copied from 
other nations, or, have other nations copied from the Hebrews? To answer this 
question we shall; first give a brief account or history of the Pentateuch and 
other books of the Old Testament from which we have taken legends, and show 
about what time they were written; and second, show that other nations were 
possessed of these legends long before that time, and that the Jews copied from 
them." <BR>- Bible Myths And Their Parallels in Other Religions By T. W. Doane © 
1882, page 92 
<P><BR>
<P>The Creation: <BR>"Structurally, Genesis 1-11 presents a fascinating insight 
into how the Bible evolved from a collection of polytheistic myths and legends 
from various cultures into a mostly coherent monotheistic account of Israelite 
history." <BR>- 101 Myths of the Bible by Gary Greenburg © 2000; page 3

  Osiris went forth into heaven.”</I> “The Egyptian Ladder consisting of the 
  bodies of two Egyptian deities upon which Osiris ascends into heaven, has been

  down between earth and heaven."<SUP>11</SUP> </P></LI></UL>
<P><BR>

    <LI>Sargon (the birth and abandonment in the river, being rescued by

    in the Hymns of Orpheus <SUP>12</SUP> <BR><BR>
    <LI>The Hebrew stint of "40 years in the desert" claimed in the Jewish book 
    of Exodus and the subsequent "40 day and 40 nights" wanderings in the desert 
    of the Jewish Nazarene were stolen from: <BR>"The struggle of Set and Horus 
    in the desert lasted forty days, as commemorated in the forty days of the 
    Egyptian Lent, during which time Set, as the power of drought and sterility, 
    made war on Horus in the water and the buried germinating grain....These 
    forty days have been extended into forty years, and confessedly so by the 
    Jews."<SUP>13</SUP> </LI></UL></LI></UL>

  <LI>The Jewish "Job," was stolen from a story written in the Ugaritic language 
  (Cuneiform Script), composed circa 1400 BCE by "Ilimilku The Scribe." This 
  epic involves "Keret" and the God "El." NOT Job and Jehova. Keret's family 
  tragedies and illness are comparable with the story of Job. In the original 
  tale, "Satan" never even entered into the picture.<BR>Here, Jewish Jehova 
  replaces El<SUP>27</SUP> </LI></UL>
<P>By creating opposing Gods, one "good" and the other "evil" the Jews have been 
able to manipulate the world beyond belief. 
<P><BR>

  <LI>The Stele of Mesha 
  <LI>The Karatepe Inscription 
  <LI>The Annals of Shalmaneser III 
  <LI>The Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III

  <LI>The Annals of Nebuchadnezzar II </LI></UL>
<P>
<UL>More stolen material in the biblical books of Ezra and Nehemiah from: 
  <LI>The Cylinder of Cyrus<SUP>31</SUP> </LI></UL>
<UL><BR><BR>
  <LI>Jewish Mordecai stolen from the Babylonian God Marduk<SUP>32</SUP>

  <LI>Jewish Thomas was stolen from Tammuz <SUP>37</SUP> <BR><BR>
  <LI>"Like Jesus, the Greek God Hermes was also wrapped in swaddling clothing 
  and placed in a manger, as was Dionysus." <SUP>38</SUP> </LI></UL>
<P><BR>
<P><BR>
<P>The Gentile Gods wound up in the grimoires of blasphemy. 
<P>"No other people has ever been so conscious of ultimate primacy through 
supernatural intervention. This has given them cohesion and courage to persevere 
in the face of persecution and decimation. The conviction that every jew will 
one day share in his divine destiny as a member of the world's ruling race has 
made him proud and has enabled him to survive unassimilated among the nations of 
the earth." <BR>"Included in the promised inheritance was a deliverer or messiah 
to bring about "the kingdom." This messiah would be either a temporal, human 
leader who with his armies would overthrow the enemies of Israel, or a 
supernatrual being who would do likewise, establishing an "everlasting" Jewish 
kingdom as well." "The Jewish imperialism would thus come as the awaited 
deliverer destroyed the enemies and gave their booty to Israel. As Larson says 
'This Messiah shall bring judgement upon the Gentiles and they shall become the 
slaves of Judah..." <BR>The above two paragraphs were excerpts taken from The 
Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold by Acharya S. © 1999 taken from 
pages 325 and 326 
 
<P>The purpose of the bible was: 
<UL>
  <LI>To give the Jewish people a history they never had. <BR><BR>
  <LI>To give the Jewish people a special status as the "Chosen of God". <BR><BR>
  <LI>To enable the Jewish people to advance in their quest for world 
  domination. The gentiles have been disarmed and spoon-fed a pacifistic 
  anti-life philosophy with Christianity. <BR><BR>
  <LI>To keep all occult, psychic and mind power under the control of the Jews 
  and disarm the gentile populations psychically. <BR><BR>
  <LI>For the Jewish secret cabal to seize and direct as much psychic energy as 
  possible into the coming of their "messiah" who will unite the Jews and rule 
  the world. (This is the fictitious Christ, - the Jews themselves know Christ 
  is fictitious- the "Temple of Solomon" and various other faces of the same 
  theme). <BR><BR>
  <LI>Because the multitude of characters, numbers and stories were stolen and 
  altered from gentile sources, they are strong enough in the gentile racial 
  memory to use as a powerful psychic tool for manipulation.</LI></UL>
