Unlike those so-called "Gods" that are false and worshipped by followers of
the enemy programs, Satan gives us wisdom, knowledge and sensible answers.
Christians and Muslims, being as deceived as they are, are at a loss to
explain. 
<P>
Most people wonder why there is so much suffering, misery and ugliness in
this world. Thousands of years ago, there was a time called "The Golden
Age." It was a time of peace, prosperity and happiness. Humans in those days
lived hundreds of years. Our Gods were with us as well. Ever since the
coming of Christianity and Islam, everything beautiful and positive turned
to ugliness and destruction. 
<P>
Now, most of you here are familiar with the powers of the mind and soul and
meditation. I remember many years ago when I was still an atheist, I was
reading a book on chakras and the book instructed to "look" at each one of
your chakras, of which I did and I got a shock that nearly knocked me off of
the sofa. That freaked me out. Now, this was a result of focusing my
attention. Most of you have had spiritual experiences where you have had
similar occurrences. Just focusing on a chakra or another area of your soul
and you find it is a very intense experience. 
<P>
I wrote about this part before, but just look around you, everything you
see, your computer screen, your chair, your bed, your furniture, the cars
outside, buildings, windows...everything you see was once someone's idea
before it materialized into a physical form in reality. Now, I also want to
add in some instances, such as with science, for example storms manifest on
their own; hot humid air colliding with cold, dry air for example, but the
majority of everything here was once someone's idea. This right here reveals
the importance of one's thinking and one's mind. Those of you who have been
meditating for any length of time know how important it is to try to focus
on positive things, as focusing on destructive thoughts, needless worry and
negativity, with a strong mind and soul one will attract this. 
<P>
The average person who does not meditate and who has a much weaker mind,
where most thoughts tend to dissipate, alone does not have much power, but
when combined with the mass mind of millions of other people who are
focusing along the same lines, then thoughts do have much more power. I came
 
across a book some 20 years ago [I can't remember the name of the book or
the author], but I read it and the author had a technique where she could
place her hands upon a book and subliminally absorb all of the information
in that book. I also heard of where the same can be done in learning a
foreign language. Most of you are familiar with the US $20.00 bill and the
9-11 incident. I also wrote of this and how the "Holy Bible" factored in, as
even more prevalent than the $20.00 bill, there is a bible in nearly every
home, in hospitals, hotel rooms, and in many other places. 
<P><A HREF="Bible_Jewish_Witchcraft.html">The Holy Bible: A Book of Jewish Witchcraft</a><P>
Psychiatrists, psychologists and others who work with the human mind give
certain tests like the Rorschach Ink Blot tests to probe into the minds of
patients in order to ascertain what they dwell on and to determine their
psychological make-up. Most people will see things in these ink blots
according to what their own experiences in life have been and how they
think, and what they dwell on. 
<P>
Now, again, most of you here are even somewhat aware of the extent of the
extreme negativity, and this is an understatement, contained in both the
Bible and the Koran. In reading through scriptures for reverse Torah
rituals, the curses against humanity are prolific to where one can't even
begin to count them all. Curse after curse, after curse and the damnation
and the most utter debased depravity. One does not have to read the Bible or
the Koran cover to cover to be influenced by or to tie into the most hideous
energy contained therein. Just focusing on this is enough, and by focusing,
I mean attending church, and of course, Muslims "pray" 5 times a day, facing
east in the direction that with the gravitational pull of the earth,
amplifies energies. 
<P>
So, just how much energy has been put into and is still being put into such
extreme destruction and negativity? This has influenced this world and
everything in it. Much of the populace is steeped in it, though lifetimes.
One individual alone doesn't have too much power, but how about tens of
millions? Most people aren't even aware of the subliminal. I like to do
crossword puzzles and in nearly every book, they have the biblical crap. In
other words, this is supposed to be common knowledge. 
<P>
Wonder why there is so much fighting and family break-ups? 
<P>
Luke 12:53 
<BR>
The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father;
 
the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the
mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against
her mother in law. 
<P>
Matthew 10:21 
<BR>
"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will
rebel against their parents and have them put to death. 
<BR>
[This one is a given with Jewish communism, where many children were
brainwashed into turning their parents over to the so-called "State" to be
put to death]. 
<P>
Matthew 10:35 
<BR>
For I have come to turn "'a man against his father, a daughter against her
mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law-
<P>
The above is only a very small portion of where human focus and energies
have been going for centuries. It doesn't matter whether a follower has read
the Bible cover to cover or is even familiar with its contents [as most
people who follow such depravity are not], he/she still connects with the
energy and with more available information regarding the human mind, one can
see this is a fact. What one thinks, believes and the energies one ties into
and identifies with determines what one is and where one is going in life.
In addition, even those who reject the Christian and Islamic programs or who
are non-believers are affected, as the mass mind is powerful enough to
influence the world. The mass mind is more powerful. 
<P>
Both with Christianity and Islam, the focus is on suffering and death.
Followers live for their death. The filthy parasitical worthless Nazarene is
worshipped - torn, ragged, beaten and bled dry. deader than a doornail.
DEATH. Every mass/church service focuses on the death of that Nazarene.
Then, of course the cannibalism 'Eat me" "Drink me, " as this creates the
necessary ties for Jewish ritual murder to succeed where they take an
abducted Gentile child into a secret back room of a synagogue and proceed to
butcher him/her after tying him/her to a cross in simulation of that
Nazarene and then drink his/her blood. The foundation for this is in
Deuteronomy- the book of instructions on how to carry out living blood
sacrifices. The Jews even openly claim it as such as to their Torah. 
<P>
I have also written about poverty. Poverty is a world-wide serious problem,
that has resulted in the deaths of millions over the centuries and has
ruined many lives. 
<P>
Matthew 6:24
<BR>
24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love
the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot
serve God and mammon.
<BR>
[MAMON (MAMMON): Mishnaic Hebrew and Aramaic for "riches." The word itself
is given in the Sermon on the Mount.]
<BR>
<A HREF="https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10339-mamon-mammon">https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10339-mamon-mammon</a> 
<BR>
Also note the above scripture, the number 6 is emphasized again. 6 and the
2+4=6. The Jews always use the number 6. through this, they direct the
 
energies into slave labor for Gentiles and of course, their own wealth and
 
riches. The Bible dupes Gentiles into accepting poverty and living for their
death, while the Jews who created this work of degeneracy and filth know
 
better. Wealth and power is concentrated in their hands. 
<P>
Matthew 19:21-26
<BR>
21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast,
and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and
follow me.
<BR>
22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he
had great possessions.
<BR>
23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich
man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
<BR>
24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye
of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
<P>
Mark 4:19
<BR>
19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the
lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh
unfruitful.
<P>
Proverbs 23: 4-5
<BR>
4 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.
<BR>
5 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make
themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
<P>
Ecclesiastes 5:10
<BR>
He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth
abundance with increase: this is also vanity.
<P>
Proverbs 11:4
<BR>
Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from
death.
<P>
2 Corinthians 9:7
<BR>
Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not
grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
<P>
Matthew 6:19-21
<BR>
19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth
corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
<BR>
20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor
rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
<P>
The above is only a small sample of indoctrination into a lifetime of
poverty. This in many cases persists into many lifetimes as it clings to the
soul. 
<P>
In the verse below, the suffering of innocent children is encouraged: 
<P>
Matthew 19:14
<BR>
But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto
me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
<P>
There was a man who both encouraged and participated the murdering of
"witches." That man was reported to have read the "Holy Bible" some 53
times. It is no wonder he displayed a murderous bent. When one worships
murder, one becomes a murderer. 
<P>
Below is a sampling of the endless murders committed by Yahweh/Jehovah in
the Bible. This is praised and extolled by Christians incessantly:

<LI></UL>
<P>
The above was taken from:
<BR><A HREF="https://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/04/drunk-with-blood-gods-killings-in-bible.html">Dwindling in Unbelief</a> 
<BR>
The above website has many more examples. The listing I included in the
above is very small. 
<P>
There is no need to elaborate on war here. That filthy bible is full of wars,
injustices, famine, endless savage cruelty and a hatred for humanity. This
is celebrated with hijacked Pagan holidays, singing for the damnation of
humanity, worshipping, focusing and giving copious amounts of energy into
promoting suffering, loss, death, misery and pain. This is soooooo obvious.
As I already mentioned, when doing some research for reverse torah rituals,
the amount of direct curses aimed at humanity was so extensive I didn't even
know where to begin and with Lilith's direction, picked out the most blatant
ones and there were also plenty of those. 
<P>
We are what we think about and dwell upon. This is where the mass mind has
been for well over two thousand years. It is no wonder there is so much pain
and suffering. There is your answer.
