This was under the Clinton Administration. George W. Bush, being a born
again Christian and so pro-Israel has more:

<P>When he was first elected, Bill Clinton promised the American people
that the makeup of his administration would mirror the face of
America. In truth, it mirrors the face of Israel. Even though the
Jews only make up 2.9% of the country's population, an astounding
56% of all of Clinton's appointments have been Jews, some of whom

<P>Undoubtedly, some of these names have changed by now, but the Jewish
character of the Clinton administration remains. The Jews are
represented twenty times their population (2.9%). Can or should we
Gentiles feel comfortable having such Jewish dominance over "our"
government? In addition, the difference between the Clinton
administration and other administrations (such as Bush's, Reagan's,
Carter's, Ford's, etc.) is one of degree rather than kind. For
example, let us take a quick look at some of the Jews in the Gerald
Ford administration:

<P><UL>
<LI>Henry Kissinger - Secretary of State (This fucker sold us out in
Viet Nam)
<LI>James Schlesinger - Secretary of Defense
<LI>John Simon - Secretary of Treasury
<LI>Caspar Weinberger - Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare
<LI>Arthur Burns - Chairman of Federal Reserve
<BR>(Bernstein) - Ford's Financial Advisor
<LI>Board Seidman - Federal Insurance Advisor
<LI>Bernstein - Press Secretary
<LI>Ron Nessen - Speechwriter
<LI>Friedman - Head of Economic Council
<LI>Alan Greenspan - Attorney General
<LI>Levy - Betty Ford's Secretary
</UL>
<P>The Jews have held key positions for decades, twisting both
America's foreign policy as well as its domestic policy to meet
their ends and the ends of Israel. Having control of our government
is certainly in keeping with the teachings of the Talmud--that the
Jews be the masters and the Goyim (Gentiles) be the slaves.

<P><I>[What better way to enslave another people than to cut them off from their God and destroy their past? Yeah, keep people away from Satan at all costs, because Satan shows us we are not slaves! Our True Creator God Satan was replaced with "YHVH" which is nothing more than a system of Jewish magick and that fictitious Jewish circumcised on the eighth day in the temple by a rabbi Nazarene that was based upon some 18 Pagan Gods who hung from a tree.]</I>

<P>The fact that America gives more financial aid to Israel than any
other nation in the world is proof positive that America's foreign
policy is directed onto a Jewish path. It is little wonder then why
much of the Arab world hates America. After all, would we befriend a
nation which gives billions to our national foes?
