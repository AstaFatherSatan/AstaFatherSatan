THE EIGHTEENTH KEY
<P>O thou mighty light and burning flame of comfort!, that unveilest the glory of Satan to the
center of the Earth; in whom the great secrets of truth have their abiding; that is called in thy
kingdom: "strength through joy", and is not to be measured. Be thou a window of comfort
unto me. Move therefore, and appear! Open the mysteries of your creation! Be friendly unto
me, for I am the same!, the true worshipper of the highest and ineffable King of Hell!

<P>&nbsp;<P>"Strength Through Joy (German: "Kraft durch Freude" [KdF]), was a large state-controlled leisure organization in Third Reich, a part of the German Labour Front (Deutschen Arbeitsfront [DAF]), the National German labour organization.

<P>From 1933 it provided affordable leisure activities such as concerts, day-trips and holidays as in Prora. Large ships, such as the Wilhelm Gustloff, were built specially for KdF cruises.

<P>The KdF also set up production of an affordable car, the KdF-Wagen, later called VW Beetle. A new town was built for the production and for housing the workers, KdF-Stadt, now called Wolfsburg. KdF organized a special saving scheme to allow ordinary workers the luxury of a car. However, due to the start of World War II very little of this was realised and both the factory and the rest of KdF became focused on supporting the war efforts."
