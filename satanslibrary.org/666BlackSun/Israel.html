<P><BR><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=3>Here is another excerpt from an article- this is in addition to the billions upon billions of free dollars the Jewish community has coerced Germany into paying on account of that phoney "holocaust":

<P>According to a recent article in the New York Times, American
taxpayers have given over $77 billion to the Jewish nation of Israel
since 1967. This huge giveaway program of the American government
actually amounts to about $16,500 for every Jew (man, woman, and
child) in the nation. Much of this money comes as a result of the
activities of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which is
the largest of the 80 odd Jewish lobbies in Washington.

<P>These lobbies are interested in getting congressmen and senators
elected that will continue Israel's favored nation status with the
U.S. Government. For example, gifts to potential candidates for the
1989-1990 election amounted to $8 million according to Federal
Election Commission reports. As a result of these bribes, Israel has
been successful in obtaining approximately $10 billion dollars in
aid last year alone. The U.S. government has virtually no say in how
this money is spent. Any attempt to monitor the cash gifts is taken
as an insult by the Israeli government which claims that as a
sovereign nation, we should keep our hands off its internal affairs.
Our hands have only one purpose--giving them more money.

<P>This one tiny nation of only four million people alone receives
approximately one third of our foreign aid, and while foreign aid is
actually decreasing to some central America and African nations, aid
to Israel is on the steady rise. The chart above shows the amount of
military and economic aid that has been given to Israel since Israel
was carved out of Arab land in 1948. The sections shown in black are
loans and the sections shown in white are gifts. The chart does not
list other types of foreign aid such as aid for transportation,
education, health services, etc.
