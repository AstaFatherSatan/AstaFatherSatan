<P><BR><FONT size=3 face=Verdana,Arial>The Kabalah is actually pretty 
straightforward when stripped of all the meaningless Jewish bullshit and 
alterations. Kabalistic magick is based upon letters and numbers, in that each 
letter corresponds with a number. The name of the letter is vibrated with a 
specific focus on a chakra of choice, <A 
href="../../www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Human_Soul.html">an aspect of the soul, the aura,</A> 
a body organ (for empowering and/or healing). The basis of this is the yogic 
"humming breath." 
<P>Example One: <BR>Healing Meditation- <BR>1. Go into a trance and breathe in 
energy into the specific organ that needs healing. Visualize this as white-gold 
like the sun. <BR>2. State your affirmation such as "I am breathing in powerful 
healing energy that is ridding my _____ of disease permanently, and making it 
strong, healthy and normal in every way. State this several times in your mind 
with intent with each breath. <BR>3. Now breathe in the energy and on the 
exhale, vibrate the name of the rune you wish to use. Say you are using the 
"Uruz" rune, you would inhale the energy and ON THE EXHALE, FOCUS THE VIBRATION 
SO YOU CAN DIRECTLY *FEEL* IT VIBRATING IN THE ORGAN: OOOOOOO-RRRRR(roll the 
R)-OOOOOOO-ZZZZZZZZZ. <BR>4. The number for Uruz is two, so you would want to 
vibrate this rune for a number corresponding to two, such as twenty times for 
each session. <BR>During the meditation, visualize the Uruz rune as you can. In 
time, when you open your mind, this can all be simultaneously. The rune should 
be shining with power. 
<P>Example Two: <BR>Empowering a chakra- <BR>Say for example you want to empower 
your heart chakra, the Gebo rune rules this chakra. <BR>1. Go into a trance and 
breathe in energy into your heart chakra. Visualize this as white-gold like the 
sun, as the sun is the esoteric ruler of the heart chakra and the center of 
power of the soul. <BR>2. Vibrate the Gebo Rune and FEEL it vibrating right in 
your heart chakra: GGGGGG-(this is guttural and the sound is prolonged in the 
back of the throat, creating a powerful energy 
circuit)-AAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY-BBBBBBBBBBB (this again is vibrated on the 
lips)OOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH. <BR>The number for Gebo is seven, so you would want to 
vibrate this rune either seven times per meditation session or a multiple of 
seven. 
<P>Example Three: <BR>Using energy to empower your aura to attract 
someone/something- <BR>1. Go into a trance, feel your aura and breathe energy 
into it. <BR>2. State your affirmation for example "I am breathing in powerful 
energy into my aura that is attracting___ to me." <BR>2. Vibrate whichever rune 
you choose that corresponds to whatever it is you wish to attract and FEEL the 
vibration in your aura. <BR>Repeat for the specific number of times 
corresponding to the rune you are using. 
<P>Tip: <BR>Rune vibrating takes a lot of practice and concentration. It is best 
to go somewhere, where you are alone and won't be disturbed, where you can 
vibrate aloud. I listen to music with my headphones as this helps me to focus on 
FEELING the vibration correctly which is so important. Use whatever works for 
you as we are all individuals.
