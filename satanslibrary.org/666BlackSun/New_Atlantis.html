The purpose of this article is to show the truth behind the creation
of the United States of America which is not what the fundies and their Jewish
masters want you to know. In essence this is the true, hidden and
Satanic history of America.
Read these before going further:

"Many leading Serpents of Wisdom were quietly drawing up plans for
what was to be a model nation across the western sea. Referred to
within closed circles of initiates as the "New Atlantis." This new
land was to be governed by the Serpents of Wisdom elected "by the
people and for the people."
<P>
In reality Europeans already new about the new world back into the
time of the Vikings as the north American rune stones prove. It's
also been shown many of the Templar's had bases in America going
back to their day. America was the goal of the Free Masons. A nation
free of the Catholic/Jewish grip, and where they could create a
nation based on solely Satanic principles. This plan was put into
work over a hundred years before the official revolution.
<P>
"Starting in the late 1600's members of the Free Masons began
leaving their comfortable lives behind in order to undertake the
long arduous journey across the Atlantic Ocean to become citizens of
the New Land of the Phoenix. Once in America they proceeded to
organize a cohesive network of Rosicrucian and Freemasonic Lodges
within a nation of 13 colonies the ancient number of the Phoenix
Dragon. In 1694 a Rosicrucian colony was established in Pennsylvania
and by the early 1700's Freemasonic Lodges were literally sweeping
across the new land. By the beginning of the Revolutionary period
there was a multitude of common lodges and seven (the number of the
Serpent) Grand Provincial Lodges scattered evenly throughout the
Thirteen Colonies."
<P>
"One of the favorite forums of the Freemasons in Boston was the
Green Dragon Tavern, where Daniel Webster referred to as "the
headquarters of the revolution." During a frenzied meeting at this
tavern a plan was hatched to resist the British tariff on tea by
destroying a new shipment of the commodity residing in Boston
Harbor. It was decided that on the night of December 6, 1773 a group
of Freemasons of Saint Andrew's Lodge would disguise themselves as
Native Americans, clandestinely board the tea ships and toss the
cargo overboard. This act was to become an unforgiving thorn in the
side of the British Crown and a full scale Revolutionary War was
declared soon afterward."
<P>
"The North American Freemasons pooled their resources in order to
organize a formidable resistance against their oppressive rulers.
They chose the Rosicrucian and Master Mason George Washington to
supervise the building of an army and brought over from Germany
Freemason Baron von Steuben to instruct the virgin troops in the art
of battle."
<P>
"The Colonial Army was a "Military Lodge" and a "Who's who of
American Colonial Freemasonry." Over 2000 of its officers were
Freemasons and out of these at least 100 were generals working
directly under Washington. Many high-ranking officers were also
Freemasonic Grandmasters. Included in this elite list was
Washington, Paul Revere and Joseph Warren, the Grandmaster of the
Massachusetts Grand Lodge who became famous for sacrificing his life
while leading a battalion up Bunker Hill."
<P>
It should also be noted the American Freemasons also had many allies
in the British government and military who where also committed to
the creation of the New Satanic Nation, and helped to secure the
creation of this nation from behind the scenes. It has been noted
during many pitched battles, masons on both sides would make the
Masonic signs to each other.
<P>
"Following their victory in the Revolutionary War, two important
documents were drawn up by the Freemasons in Philadelphia, a city
ostensibly named after Philadelphia, the name of the "Supreme
Secret Society" of Freemasons in France."
<P>
"The first of their documents, the Declaration of Independence, was
authored principally by the Freemason Thomas Jefferson and signed
primarily by the high ranking Freemasons, of the 56 signers of the
document, 50 were Freemasons, including the Grandmaster John
Hancock."
<P>
"After the Philadelphia Convention the government of the United
States began to take concrete form as the country's first President,
the Freemasonic Grandmaster George Washington, was sworn in by
Robert Livingston, Grandmaster of the New York Lodge. With hordes of
attending Freemasons cheering the inauguration, a new "Nation of the
Phoenix" was officially born."
<P>
A similar gathering was held in which the cornerstone of the new
capital was lain. This ceremony was executed by the Grand Lodge of
Maryland and several lodges under the jurisdiction of Washington's
Virginia Lodge. As was his practice, President Washington attended
the service in full Freemasonic ceremonial regalia complete with
apron."
<P>
"When the wheels of the United States government finally began to
turn, the new institution resembled one huge Freemasonic Lodge. Most
of the high ranking officials in all three branches of government
were either Freemasons or allied with the principles of Freemasonry.
While the Grandmaster Washington was presiding over the Executive
Branch of the government, John Marshall, a brother master mason from
Washington's Virginia Lodge, was chairing the Judicial Branch as its
first Chief Justice.  The majority of lawmakers in the House of
Representatives and Senate were also Freemasons."
<P>
"Of all the early American Serpents who laid the foundation work for the
new nation, none is more important than Benjamin Franklin, a Rosicrucian,
Freemason and Grandmaster of numerous secret societies."
<P>
"Franklin created the Leather Apron Club, one of the earliest of
Freemasonic Lodges in America. It served as a vehicle
for "preparing members for citizenship in a yet-to-be-born nation."
Following this, Franklin acquired initiation into a Freemasonic lodge
in Philadelphia and was alter elected as Grandmaster over all lodges
within the state of Pennsylvania."
<P>
"In order to make the Freemasonic rites uniform within the 13
colonies, Franklin composed and published a series of "Masonic by-
laws, manuals and constitutions" which served to standardize the
rites and philosophies adhered to by the Colonial Serpents.  He also
published numerous treatises within which he encoded Rosicrucian
wisdom along with a "call to arms" to all those ready to join in the
fight for freedom. One of his occult literary vehicles was the
famous Poor Richard's Almanac."
<P>
"Franklin's activity also included membership in the Apollonian
Society, an esoteric fraternity founded upon the rites and
principles of the ancient Egyptian and Atlantean Serpents of Wisdom."
<P>
It should also be noted, Franklin, while on diplomatic mission in
France lived in the main Masonic lodge in Paris and was also
initiated into French societies. He and his Masonic brothers in
France got France to become involved in the war in America which
enabled the final victory of the Satanists and the creation of the
New Atlantis. Hence why America has the statue of Liberty. A gift
from the French masons to commemorate such events.
<P>
Franklin also used the symbol of the Serpent in many of his works.
 
<P>"Franklin is well known for making his own life a reflection of the
spiritual principals he preached to other masons..  He led a pure
spiritual life punctuated by vegetarianism and daily meditation.
His prodigious philanthropic activities included the creation of
numerous libraries, hospitals and firehouses.  Franklin was also a
crusader for the creation of positive relations with the Native
Americans and eventually became an honorary member of various
tribes.  Through his efforts numerous treaties were created between
the North American tribes and the Unites States government."
 
<P>"The Freemason and Rosicrucian George Washington is considered the
greatest of leaders during the United States earliest hours.
Exhibiting spiritually precocious gifts from a young age, Washington
was initiated into the Lodge of Alexandria Virginia as an Entered
Apprentice when just twenty years old. Two years later he became the
lodge's first Master Mason and later ascended to the degree of Royal
Arch, one of the highest of Master Mason degrees. Washington was also
honorably inducted into Mystics of the Wissahickon, the American
Supreme Rosicrucian Council, which was instrumental in constructing
both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution."
 
<P>"When Washington assumed the office of president he was
simultaneously elevated to serve as honorary Grandmaster over all
the Freemasonic Lodges in the United States."
 
<P>"Washington's funeral was an elaborate Freemasonic affair. The
service was based upon the ancient Egyptian rites of resurrection
and presided over by three Freemasons from Washington's Alexandrian
Lodge.  Masonic symbols of sprigs of acacia, crossed swords and his
apron where placed on his casket."
 
<P>"A motion was introduced in Congress by Freemason John Marshall to
erect a memorial in honor of the first president. It was decided
that the most appropriate monument for the late Grandmaster
Freemason was the Egyptian "frozen snake," the obelisk. Soon
afterwards, in 1793, a special ceremony was held in which the
Freemason Robert Mills used square, level and plumb, the symbolic
tools of Freemasonry, to lay the cornerstone of what was to become
a 600 foot obelisk, the tallest structure of its kind in the world."
 
<P>"A Freemason, Rosicrucian and initiate of the French order of the
Nine Sisters. Thomas Jefferson was another important Serpent and
founding father. An important contributor to both the Declaration
and Constitution and under his guidance the first American
University was founded in Virginia. Modeled after the Lyceum of
Greece and the Alexandrian Museum, Jefferson's university resembled
an ancient mystery academy of the Serpents and offered a curriculum
similar to that taught within the Museum."
<P>
"Jefferson was chosen by the North American Serpents to oversee the
creation of a "New Alexandria" because of his intellectual and
spiritual achievements. He was a recognized adept of most practical
sciences including chemistry, botany, anatomy, surgery, zoology,
natural philosophy, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, geography,
politics and law. He was also an occult genius who had studied the
esoteric wisdom and communicated the ancient mysteries through
secret ciphers. His work with ciphers or secret codes earned
Jefferson the title of "Father of American Cryptography."
 
<P>"In this creation of his "New Alexandria" Jefferson brought together
all the most renowned American teachers in both the scientific and
religious fields. To house the classrooms of these adepts and their
students, Jefferson constructed a campus of magnificent temples
similar to those of the ancient Museum. Within the walls of these
temples diverse subjects as chemistry, mathematics, religion,
philosophy and metaphysics coexisted harmoniously and supportively.
