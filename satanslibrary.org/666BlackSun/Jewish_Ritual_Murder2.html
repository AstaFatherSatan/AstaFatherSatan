The Jews work very hard to keep Satanists/Pagans from being heard when speaking of the Jewish crimes against humanity.  The most you'll usually find regarding the truth about the Jewish ritual murders are from Christians.  In the Talmud and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the Jews have replaced the term Gentile (Pagan/Satanist, who's God is Satan) with "Christian" and "Christ."  As High Priestess Maxine wrote in a sermon about how the Jews deceive, "Christian" is a code word for Pagan/Satanist.  With this being said, the Jews are not blaspheming their beloved messiah Jesus of Nazareth (Ben Yahashua), but Satan who is the true God of the Gentiles.  There are millions of other cases of Jewish ritual murder, but here is a comprehensive list that covers from the years before the common era to 1932.  Satan demands that Gentiles see the Jews for the sick murdering pedophile, lying bastards that they really are.  Those who read this and still don't have a problem with the Jewish race, have a death wish.

"Human sacrifices are to-day still practised by the Jews of Eastern Europe.... as is set forth at length by the late Sir Richard Burton in the MS which the wealthy Jews of England have compassed heaven and earth to suppress, and evidenced by the ever-recurring Pogroms against which so senseless an outcry is made by those who live among those degenerate Jews who are at least not cannibals." - Aleister Crowley

They therefore searched for a stranger which they could get in their power.

1911 A.D. -- The 13-year-old schoolboy, Andrei Youshchinsky was murdered in Kiev on March 12th. After eight days, his corpse was found in a brickyard completely slashed to pieces and bloodless. Suspicion fell on the Jewish manager of the brickyard, Mendel Beiliss. The case did not come to trial until two and a half years later (Sept. 29th to Oct. 28th, 1913). In the intervening period numerous attempts were made to lead the investigating officers on to the wrong track. Meanwhile a large number of incriminating witnesses suffered sudden and unnatural deaths; false accusations and confessions followed one after another due to huge money bribes. Behind the accused lurking in the shadows, was the figure of Faivel Schneerson of the Lubavitchers, leader of the 'Zadiks' ('Saints') of the Chassidim sect, who was the spiritual director of the murder. The trial ended with the release of Beiliss, but at the same time the court established that the murder had taken place inside the Jewish brickyard, which was the religious center of the Kiev Jews, for the purpose of obtaining blood. Almost all the prosecutors, witnesses, and authorities who had spoken out against Judaism, later fell victim to the Bolshevik Terror.

"These are 131 ritual murders which are known and have been passed down to posterity in writing. [LSN: There are actually some others, particularly in the ancient period, which are not listed here.] How many have occurred and nobody today knows about them! How many thousands, yes, perhaps HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS have remained undiscovered! To torture young, innocent human beings, to kill and drink their blood, this is the greatest and most terrible aspect of all the crimes which International Jewry has taken upon itself!"

This information came from a source that had a xian bias to it, but the fact that the majority of the earth's population haven't figured out yet is that Jewish and the sister title "Christian" are none but the same.  "Christian" is actually a title that Jews give to the dupes who have fallen under the spell of that Jewish "religion" called Christianity.
