"They (the Jews) work more effectively against us than the enemy's
armies. They are a hundred times more dangerous to our liberties and
the great cause we are engaged in. It is much to be lamented that
each state, long ago, has not hunted them down as pests to society
and the greatest enemies we have to the happiness of America."

<P>As the American colonies rose in revolt against political oppression
occasioned by the attempt of Jewish banking houses in Europe to
consolidate their economic foothold in the New World, no man among
the Founding Fathers was more alert to the designs of international
Jewry than that shrewd elder statesman of the American Revolution,
Benjamin Franklin. Perhaps Ben Franklin's most damning indictment of
Jewry was contained in his famous prophecy at the Constitutional
Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia. In one of the most anti-Jewish
utterances of all time, he declared:


<P>"I fully agree with General Washington, that we must protect this
young nation from an insidious influence and impenetration. That
menace, gentlemen, is the Jews. In whatever country Jews have
settled in any great number, they have lowered its moral tone;
depreciated its commercial integrity; have segregated themselves and
have not been assimilated; have built up a state within a state;
and when opposed have tried to strangle that country to death
financially, as in the case of Spain and Portugal.

<P>"For over 1700 hundred years, the Jews have been bewailing their sad
fate in that they have been exiled from their homeland, as they call
Palestine. But, gentlemen, did the world give it to them in fee
simple, they would at once find some reason for not returning. Why?
Because they are vampires, and vampires do not live on vampires.
They cannot live only amongst themselves. They must subsist on
other people not of their race. If you do not exclude
them from these United States in the Constitution, in less than 200
years they will have swarmed here in such great numbers that they
will dominate and devour the land, and change our form of
government, for which we Americans have shed our blood, given our
lives, our substance, and jeopardized our liberty.

<P>"If you do not exclude them, in less than 200 years our descendants
will be working in the fields to furnish them substance, while they
will be in the counting houses rubbing their hands. I warn you,
gentlemen, if you do not exclude the Jews for all time, your
children will curse you in your graves."


<P>Franklin's remarks were recorded in "Chit Chat Around the Table
During Intermissions," a section of the Diary of Charles Cotesworth
Pinckney of South Carolina. Pickney (1746-1825) attended the
Convention as a delegate, and took down excerpts of some of the
outstanding addresses and discourses, which he later published in
his diary. Perhaps the best proof of the Franklin prophecy--as with
any prophecy--lies in its actual fulfillment. What Benjamin Franklin
foresaw as an ominous possibility in 1787 has today--a little over
two hundred years later--become painful reality.
