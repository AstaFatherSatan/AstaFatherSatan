<P><BR><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=3><B>Few people study the occult to any real depth. Misinformation and confusion are what most people have. “Satanism” has been applied to many things; mainly anything that represents the cultural concept of “evil” which is different in each culture. 
<P>
On one hand, Pagan practices have been labeled as “Satanic” even though the xian churches stole and altered them for their own uses. Then, on the other hand, we have the Grimoires and “Black Books.” In truth, these are *NOT* of Satanism. 
<P>
The Jewish “God” Yaweh/Jehova, his angels and his nazarene are used in works of black magick and forcing Demons to appear. The “Key of Solomon” is a prime example of a Jewish written grimoire (which nearly all are). 
<P>
The sorcerer/operator (usually a rabbi or other Jew) in preparation goes through a preparatory period of fasting, celibacy, prayers to Yaweh/Jehova. When the operation is performed, (this can include living blood sacrifice of animals or human beings as dictated in the Old Testament of the bible: <B>“And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh. “-Deuteronomy 12:27</B>) the operator casts a nine-foot circle and places a triangle off to the side of the enclosed circle for a Demon to be forced to appear.

<P><I>I (Name) Servant of God do conjure, cite, and exorcise thee, O Spirit! by the five most
holy wounds of Jesus Christ by his flesh and blood, by his torments and passion, by his life
and death and by the precious drops of blood which he has shed for the salvation and
sanctification of the human race - by his anguish and distress, and by the most Holy
and terrible words - Soter + Choma + Geno + Jehovah + Elohim + Rilach

[i.e. Malach] + and + by + the words by which Solomon + Manasses +Agrippa+ and
cyprian + called together the Spirits - and even as Jesus Christ sent from him his spirit - and
delivered it up onto the hands of his heavenly Father - so do I command thee that thou
appearesst without delay, and comest before me, in a most beautiful affable and
human form - and bring to me (out of the Spiritual Abyss (N + + +) without doing
injury to me, without tumult - without thunder - without tempest, without fear - and
without trembling and place before this circle - and this I command thee by the Deity
and humanity of Jesus Christ
<br>Amen
<P>To discharge the Spirits
<P>Now I command and charge thee Evil Spirit! that thou shalt bring to me immediately
that which I commanded thee - and shalt depart from the circle- abstaining from all
noise - terror - tumult - and ill savour [sic] - which if thou dost not I will punish thee
both in body and in soul - abstaining from all evil to any creature or thing and depart
immediately to the place which the justice of God hath set apart for you

<P><BR>To clarify things for people who in truth have no idea what real Satanism is- "Aleister Crowley" was not a Satanist. Satanists do not establish abusive relationships with Demons who are the Original Pagan Gods, nor do they pray to "Yaweh/Jehova" or his Nazarene.
