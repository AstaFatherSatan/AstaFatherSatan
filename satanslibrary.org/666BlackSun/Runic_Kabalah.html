Few people have an understanding of what the kabalah is due to centuries of the removal of knowledge and the mass murder [on behalf of the Catholic Church] of the people who had it, namely Gentile priests and spiritual leaders. 
 
 
<P>Cutting through the Bullshit 
<BR>In studying the history of many of the different known manuscripts of occult disciplines and grimoires, one will find that nearly all, if not all have been drastically altered. It appears that with every important manuscript, a Jew had to have a hand in either "deciphering" "translating" or just "helping" to put it together. For so small a number of the population, it seems this people are always relentlessly working to have control at key points. The result is the desecration of Gentile spiritual texts in order to remove magickal knowledge and strip the Gentiles of all occult powers. 
<P>
The runes seem to have been an extreme threat to the Catholic Church as the penalty for using runes or even having knowledge of them was death. The Jewish tool of xianity hunted down and mass murdered Druid Priests, religious leaders and many other Gentile Pagan Mages to near extinction. Because of this, what is available regarding runic magick in the mainstream bookstores is flawed. 
<P>For example, the most important pronunciation of the runes is usually given in American English. This flaw is glaringly apparent. The runes are Germanic and Norse in origin, so why would we want to vibrate them using American English?? By the way, vibrating the runes is the most powerful and is the foundation of the True Runic Kabalah. It is obvious with the information readily available out there, that the Germanic umlauts have been omitted, along with many other guttural pronunciations, which are extremely important to correctly using the runes. 
<P>
When deep in meditation and vibrating a certain rune some time ago, Satan came to me and told me to "roll the R's fully." This takes practice for those who do not have this in their native language, but comes in time, and when one has mastered the correct vibrations; one will find the results of one's efforts in applying magick quickly forthcoming. How accurately and smoothly one performs the vibration for the specified number of times corresponding to the rune will determine the power and success of the working. 
<P>
Unbeknownst to many, there is an Egyptian Kabalah, a Gothic Kabalah, a Phoenician Kabalah, and a Greek Kabalah among others. The originally Egyptian phrase: "In the Beginning was the word" was stolen from Ancient Egypt (Phony Jewish Yaweh replaces the Egyptian God Ptah), *Reference: 101 Myths of the Bible by Gary Greenburg © 2000 pages 11-13. 
The entire universe vibrates and through vibration, we greatly empower our soul and amplify our magick. The original alphabet is based upon the constellations. Like everything else, the Jews have tried to claim "Hebrew was the original language and alphabet" but this is NOT SO. With the necessary research using reliable secular sources and texts, one will find "Hebrew" was taken from Phoenician and other languages predating it. It also appears that Hebrew was taken from Hindi in that the letters have similarities and many of their words have their origins in Hindi. For anyone with any knowledge, we all know the bible was written to give the Jews a history and status they never had nor are they entitled to. 
<P>
The runes can be traced back to Ancient Phoenician and cuneiform scripts. This is their power. Many of the correct pronunciations have unfortunately been lost due to the systematic destruction of spiritual knowledge and its replacement with Hebrew Bullshit.
