Please note that some of the exercises within Hell's Army 666 are very advanced. With patience and persistence, you will find that you will excel in some, but not with others, which will require much more time. This is normal. Never get discouraged or frustrated with yourself. Even very advanced souls and so-called "masters" have weak areas. The purpose of these exercises are to acquaint you with the various powers of your soul. For new people, most of these will be dormant. You are not expected to be able to let alone master all of the exercises in the time period given. Patience and above all, persistence will result in success beyond your expectations. 

<P>ALSO... The Mudras [hand postions] for opening the chakras are NOT necessary for any of the exercises. These are optional and those who have larger hands can find some of the mudras impossible. What IS important are the correct vibrations. 

<P>A deep trance is not necessary either. This is not always possible. It is important to get into a calm and relaxed state and to do your best with the exercises given. I have done quite a few of the exercises, such as invoking the elements without having entered into a deep trance. Like everythign else, the ability to get yourself into a trance will come with patience, persistence and time. 

<P>Always ask any questions you might have or post any concerns in the Joy of Satan e-groups and forums. I apologize for not having updated this section of the JoS website. Please understand, we are small staffed, the Gods of Hell keep heaping more work onto us, as things are in the critical stage and urgent. We also have plenty of daily chores and such to tend to. No one who is truly dedicated to Satan has much free time.
