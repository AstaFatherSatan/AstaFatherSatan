<P><BR><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=3>Those of you who have gotten this far will have to make an important choice. The meditations from this point on can be very dangerous. I am speaking from experience here. There are many authors who write from a theoretical scholastic prospective and have not had the direct experience with certain meditations and psychic practices. I am going to give you *my* personal experiences with the meditations that follow. Remember- THESE ARE MY OWN DIRECT EXPERIENCES AND SOME OF WHAT I EXPERIENCED, YOU MAY OR MAY NOT AS WE ARE INDIVIDUALS, BUT THESE MEDITATIONS *ARE* HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, POWERFUL AND DANGEROUS. 

<P>If you:
<UL>
<LI>Are not physically and/or mentally healthy
<LI>If you take *any* psychiatric medications or medications that affect your brain/nervous system
<LI>If you suffer from High Blood Pressure
<LI>If you have heat flashes from menopause
<LI>If you are pregnant
<LI>If you suffer bouts of depression
<LI>If you do not know yourself 100%
<LI>If you are prone to having seizures or have epilepsy
</UL>

<P>I strongly encourage you to turn back and work on the meditations you are having problems with or still need to master. Once you have overcome any problems mentioned above using safer meditations, you can proceed at a <U>very slow</U> pace if you think you are ready. Let me explain:

<P>With the meditations that follow, we will be invoking the elements. Ok- here are some examples of what can happen:

<P>Invoking fire will make you hot. Depending on how many breaths you do (only seven and under are recommended for those who have not had experience with this element). Even with adepts, 20 breaths can be extreme. While you are doing the fire meditation for the first time, more than likely while you are doing it, you will feel little or nothing. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF DOING ANY MORE BREATHS BECAUSE YOU MIGHT FEEL NOTHING! More than likely, you will feel the effects hours later. The effects of invoking fire include a fever, feeling BURNING HOT after a warm glow/aura manifests, insomnia and since water is the opposite of fire, you can get a backlash of water and this can manifest in depression. These effects can last several hours to several days. 

<P>Invoking air can overstimulate the nervous system. Air can make you very irritable and oversensitive for a few hours to several days, depending on how much you take in. 

<P>There is much more to this and I will post full articles on each element. I have always been a person of extremes and I am daring, so I have never put any limitations on myself with meditation, though I have always used common sense. Now, with invoking these elements over a period of time, we become resistant to extremes of temperature, we can warm or cool our bodies at will and we can be adept at pyrokinesis, cryokinesis and other astral disciplines. There is no gain without pain. 

<P>If you are planning to continue on, I seriously urge you to keep written entries in a black book or journal regarding how these exercises affect you. Mastering the elements is one of the highest forms of magick, while others play around with props. 

<P>There are two ways of invoking the elements. One way is total invocation as I have done (no breathing them back out and the most dangerous) and the other way is easier is to breathe the element back out into the ether. You can work up from this. 

<P>Each one of us has strengths and weaknesses with certain elements. Nearly all of us have imbalances of the elements in our souls. The following meditations will correct these.
