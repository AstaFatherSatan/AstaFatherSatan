There is a positive and negative side to all things to
keep them in balance -- <BR>to keep the Universe going.
There are awful and terrible things that must
happen, destructive deathly things, and there are
good and miraculous things that must happen full
of life and creative construction. It seems this
would come to each randomly and it seems thus it
should continue this way for eternity. This is not
true. And this is the essence of Who I Am.

<P>The world is to evolve out of this. There is always
another way to do a thing. That way is far away. But
it is still a possible way. Destruction and terror
will not always be the other way. But until the time
comes when destruction and terror are removed the
world you must work how the world works. Until that time,
that will come in time, this is Me -- a Perfect
Balance. This is necessary. Destruction and
creation. 
<P>Since the time is not yet, and you are in
the time that is not yet, destruction and creation are
in your hands as they are Mine. Do not be afraid to
do these things. Until the time comes where these
things have found more peaceable means you must keep
the earth in balance. Do not be afraid to destroy.
Do not be afraid to create. LISTEN to Me. Create
with all of your being. Destroy with all of your
being. You will not be more created by creating any
more than you will be destroyed by destroying. Are
you more created now? Are you here or are you
destroyed? You are here. You will be here as long as
I am here and that is forever. Listen to what I tell
you. If I tell you to create -- do it. And do it
with perfection and pleasure. And if I tell you to
destroy, do it. Do not hesitate. Destroy with all of
your might and pleasure; yes, I tell you to delight in
what you have destroyed.
