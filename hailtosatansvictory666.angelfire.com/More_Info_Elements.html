Opposed to the plethora of warnings in the older meditation texts, one should 
 
gradually build their tolerance to the elements. We have found these warnings to have 
 
no more credibility than the "three-fold" crap.  Some of us, myself included, have 
 
breathed in fire for well over 100 breaths, BUT, we worked up to this level patiently 
 
over a period of time. In order to perform fire magick with formidable intensity, one 
 
must be able to hold the fire element in large amounts and have a tolerance for it. The 
 
same goes for the other elements. One who can hold their fire element is capable of 
 
totally incinerating a victim of a black magick spell, who has no tolerance to this 
 
element. This comes in time. 
 
<P>The Akasha/Ether/Quintessence we have found is a primer. Quintessence 
 
intensifies any working. This element is closely related to fire and when working with it 
 
on a daily basis, one will find the body temperature rises. The rise in body 
 
temperature seems to be lasting. When willing something to be, it can be imprinted in 
 
the quintessence, making it much more powerful. In absorbing the quintessence, 
 
which is ultra-violet light, one way is to visualize a "black light" which was popular in 
 
the 1970's to make posters glow. The color of the black light is the color of the 
 
quintessence. 
 
<P>More information regarding the elements and their specific uses is forthcoming.
