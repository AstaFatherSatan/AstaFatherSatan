<P><span>Day Sixteen: Invoking Fire</span>
<BR>To invoke fire, go into a light to medium trance and visualize yourself in the middle of a large sphere of fire. Feel the heat, the burning. Now, do the energy breathing. Breath in the fire from all sides of your body, front, back, top of your head and bottom of your feet. Imagine yourself getting burning hot. Do this for seven breaths  AND ONLY SEVEN BREATHS! DO NOT DO ANY MORE! YOU CAN EVEN DO AS LITTLE AS 2-3 BREATHS, BUT NO MORE THAN SEVEN! 

<P>You have two options for this exercise:
<P>1. You can breathe the fire back out into the ether after each inhaliation and even breath it out some more when you are finished with the seven breaths [This is the safest way]<p><center> OR</center>

<p>2. You can retain the fire. With retention of the elements, you will progress faster, understand how each element feels and affects you and increase your ability to handle each element, but remember- this is not for everyone. It is better to take things slower and use caution. Remember to always use common sense. 


<P>&nbsp;<P>To be adept, one must master blowing (directing the exhale) the element out as we will in following meditations. For example, blowing out the element of fire after you have invoked enough of it and your body can withstand high amounts of this element, you can raise the temperature of objects and even set them on fire, using only your mind. Unlike the article on pyrokinesis on the Joy of Satan website, with the above, you can even be miles from your object. In meditations that follow, we will be working on heating glasses of water and such for beginning in exercising this power.

<P><span>Day Seventeen</span>
<P>Today, sit quietly and meditate on how you feel after invoking the fire element. How did you feel during the past 24 hours? It is important to be able to *feel* the elements in order to direct and control them.  

<P>&nbsp;<P><center><IMG SRC="PentagramBar5.gif"></center>


<P><BR><span>Day Eighteen</span>
<P>Sit quietly and go into a light to medium trance. Now, imagine yourself in the air. Feel the lightness and breathe in the air element. It is important to imagine yourself feeling lighter and lighter and airy. Imagine that your body is becoming lighter, as light as air itself to where you can no longer feel your body. 
<BR>Do this for seven breaths AND ONLY SEVEN BREATHS! DO NOT DO ANY MORE! YOU CAN EVEN DO AS LITTLE AS 2-3 BREATHS, BUT NO MORE THAN SEVEN! 

<P>You have two options for this exercise: 

<P>1. You can breathe the air back out into the ether after each inhaliation and even breath it out some more when you are finished with the seven breaths (This is the safest way) OR 

<P>2. You can retain the air. With retention of the elements, you will progress faster, understand how each element feels and affects you and increase your ability to handle each element, but remember- this is not for everyone. It is better to take things slower and use caution. Remember to always use common sense. 

<P>After some 12-24 hours, sit quietly and meditate a few minutes on how you feel after invoking air. 


<P>&nbsp;<P>The air element is used in rituals to incite chaos. Air can over-stimulate the nervous system until you get used to it so it is important to go slowly. Invoking air is used for levitation.

<P><BR><span>Day Nineteen</span>
<BR>To invoke water, go into a light to medium trance and imagine that you are completely under water in a large pool or lake. The water should be still. Just relax. Breath in the water from all sides of your body, front, back, top of your head and bottom of your feet. Imagine yourself getting ice cold. Do this for seven breaths AND ONLY SEVEN BREATHS! DO NOT DO ANY MORE! YOU CAN EVEN DO AS LITTLE AS 2-3 BREATHS, BUT NO MORE THAN SEVEN!

<P>&nbsp;<P>The more advanced you become, the more you will feel the coldness of the water element. You should feel like a block of ice. Adepts are able to keep the body cold as ice even in the hottest of summer weather. The water element can incite depression, so it is important to go slowly. Water is used in rituals involving attraction.

<P><BR><span>Day Twenty</span>
<BR>To invoke the earth element, go into a light to medium trance and visualize yourself in the middle of a large sphere of heavy dense gravity. Now, do the energy breathing. Breath in the earth from all sides of your body, front, back, top of your head and bottom of your feet. Imagine yourself getting heavier to where you are like lead and can no longer move- like you are buried under several feet of dirt. Do this for seven breaths AND ONLY SEVEN BREATHS! DO NOT DO ANY MORE! YOU CAN EVEN DO AS LITTLE AS 2-3 BREATHS, BUT NO MORE THAN SEVEN!

<P>&nbsp;<P>The earth element is used in binding rituals. Invoking earth can also help to still and quiet your mind for meditation.
