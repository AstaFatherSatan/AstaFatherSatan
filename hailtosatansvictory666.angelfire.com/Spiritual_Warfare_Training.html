<P><BR><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=3>As for techniques- who and how to psychically attack- ask for guidance from Satan and his Demons. They will lead you to what you need to know. Just be open. 
<P>This is a simple step-by-step program, that if followed consistently, will produce results within six months. Remember, the six month time period is a major step upward and is a preparation for the higher levels of ability. When you can focus completely and clearly for five minutes, you have reached a competent level. You can work more on these than the minimum in the lessons given. You can do these as often as you wish to advance at a faster rate, but it is very important to stick with this program. 

<P>I suggest you keep a black book or journal and record your strengths and weaknesses, any notable experiences or impressions or anything you feel is important. Ask yourself how the meditation felt, how you felt afterwards, the next day, any problems you might have had in doing the meditation, etc.

<P><BR><P>It is important to follow the instructions for each day and only do the meditations given. 


<P>By following this program one can obtain an advanced level of mind power within a six month period. It is very important to start at the beginning. Being able to maintain your full concentration, free of any distracting thoughts with any of the meditations for a full five minutes indicates proficiency. These meditations unfold step by step, each meditation prepares for the next level. It is very important to have a solid foundation as this will prepare one for advanced practices and realization of psychic powers. 


<P><BR><P>For any questions or concerns, please post these to the e-groups.
