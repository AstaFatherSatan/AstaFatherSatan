With this section, you will learn which elements are dominant in your soul and which are lacking. To properly invoke, direct, and control the elements, you should be balanced in all of the elements. Most of us have imbalances. These can usually be seen in our astrology charts. Part One will deal with the characteristics of each of the elements that manifest in human beings. As we progress, I will post articles concerning the different aspects of elemental magick and how to use the elements in workings. Please study everything in this spiritual warfare section. Those of us who progress and continue on will be working some extremely advanced magick. I will post these on the JoS group about a week before they are scheduled. We will hit the enemy especially hard at the right time as a group and coordinate our efforts. 

<P>You must be honest with yourself and know yourself. Below are attributes of each of the elements in their pure form. Very few of us are imbalanced with just one element; usually there are two that are dominant. Look to the elements where most of the characteristics describe you. By balancing your elements, you will find healing physically, psychologically, at the soul level and mentally. 

<P>IMPORTANT!!
<BR>Update: 18/January/2015
<BR>The information below was written back in 2005. I have found some of this to be inaccurate in regards to those lacking an element. The characteristics are often expressed in a different way. A lack of water does not mean the person is unfeeling. The exact opposite is often true. Adolf Hitler who lacked water was one of the most caring persons. He was also very emotional as could be seen in his speeches. 

<P>Heinrich Himmler, though lacking in earth was exceptionally hard working, responsible and reliable. His grand fire and grand air trines made him exceptionally creative and gave him a sense of idealism. 

<P>Helen Keller who was both blind and deaf spent her entire life communicating. She lacked air [communication]. She authored several books and gave numerous speeches. 


<P>The information below regarding the lack of an element is traditional and by the book. I deleted this as it has proved to be inaccurate. Just remember, individuals lacking an element tend to express the characteristics of that element in a different way. 

<P><BR>Fire is opposite Water and Air is opposite Earth. The opposite element is what is needed to fix the imbalance. It is important to be aware that invoking the lacking element can create a temporary backlash in the over-dominant element. 

<P>&nbsp;<P>Fire

<P>Characteristics: 
<BR>Self-centered, confident, enthusiastic, expressive, bold, subjective, expansive, out-going, extroverted, insensitivity to others, impulsive, impatient, creative, vain, extravagant, reckless, passionate, self-important, exhibitionist, courageous, adventuresome. 

<P>Fire people often burn themselves out. They are often over-active, restless, and over concerned with making something happen in the world. There are often problems in dealing with others; they can be very insensitive and crude in their approach.

They are practical, grounded, and cool-headed. They are hard working, dislike change and can be stuck in a routine for years without ever getting bored. They have a hard time adjusting to new situations and changes. 



<P>&nbsp;<P>Air

<P>Characteristics: 
<BR>The ability to be objective and detached, unemotional, intellectual, enjoy spontaneity, easily bored, very talkative and communicative, they are the most social of the elements. They are usually quick in their movements and speedy. They can be very impractical. Air lacks feeling and emotion. Air is pure intellect. Air people can adapt and adjust to situations easy. There can be an over-active mind, one who lives in his/her head, Jack-Of-All-Trades, and master of none, a lack of depth, air headed, a lack of planning, scatterbrained, nervousness, high-strung, and nervous exhaustion.
